He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.", "model_summary": ["Quds Force is a branch of the Revolutionary Guards in Iran responsible for intelligence and military operations in Iraq.", "They conduct social capital experiments, buy support, and fund mosques and clinics."], "label": [0, 0], "source": "mediasum_test"}

Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.", "model_summary": ["Control and decision-making in Tehran is a complex and dysfunctional process, with multiple institutions and personalities involved.", "The Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards and ultimately report to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but decisions are made through a consensus-building process.", "The Quds Forces conduct military and intelligence operations in Iraq, but also conduct social capital experiments, fund mosques and clinics.", "They have been accused of training Hezbollah and having a presence in Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia."], "label": [0, 1, 0, 0], "source": "mediasum_test"}

Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.\nMr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.", "model_summary": ["The Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force is responsible for intelligence and military operations in Iraq.", "They have social capital experiments, funding mosques and clinics, and are versatile in their operations.", "The Quds Forces operate in Lebanon as well and have a presence in Saudi Arabia's Shiite majority eastern province."], "label": [0, 0, 1], "source": "mediasum_test"}

Also, President Bush's immigration plan, he's planning, as you know, a prime time address on Monday night. We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story. And Bush versus Clinton, how does the current president stack up against the previous one? We hit the streets to find out. We've got some new poll numbers on that. Lots more coming up, Lou, at the top of the hour.\nDOBBS: Looking forward to it. Thank you, Wolf. An update tonight on the story we reported here last night. A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate.

But they only last a couple of weeks whereas the political Olympics here in the United States pitting Mitt Romney against President Obama will last all summer and then go into the fall. The competition I must say is already in full swing. CNN's John Berman is joining us now to take a closer look at what's going on. John, the events -- are the candidates competing in -- what are these events? Give us a little sense.\nJOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.\nBERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.\nBERMAN: Pole vault, the latest \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.\nROMNEY: Create jobs.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.\nBERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.\nJOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.\nBERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.\nROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.\nBERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.\nBERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Who writes that material? Do you write all that yourself, John?\nBERMAN: I have a staff of thousands.\nBLITZER: That's terrific writing.\nBERMAN: Thank you. I appreciate that very much.\nBLITZER: Great stuff.

That \"EARLY START\" starts at 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. Eastern only on CNN. Get up early even if you don't check it out. I think you'll like it. Mitt Romney himself is making the political Olympic analogy touting his experience organizing the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002. Listen to what he tells CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview in London that will air later tonight.\nROMNEY: The country is in need of a turnaround. The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.\nBLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on \"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT\" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. All right, let's talk a little bit about that and more in our \"Strategy Session\" joining us our CNN political contributor, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and our CNN contributor, Ana Navarro.

So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.\nBERMAN: Pole vault, the latest \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.\nROMNEY: Create jobs.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.\nBERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.\nJOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.\nBERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.\nROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.\nBERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.\nBERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Who writes that material? Do you write all that yourself, John?\nBERMAN: I have a staff of thousands.\nBLITZER: That's terrific writing.\nBERMAN: Thank you. I appreciate that very much.\nBLITZER: Great stuff.

The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.\nBLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on \"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT\" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

Give us a little sense.\nJOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.\nBERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.\nBERMAN: Pole vault, the latest \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.\nROMNEY: Create jobs.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.\nBERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.\nJOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.\nBERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.\nROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.\nBERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.\nBERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.\nBLITZER: Who writes that material? Do you write all that yourself, John?\nBERMAN: I have a staff of thousands.\nBLITZER: That's terrific writing.\nBERMAN: Thank you. I appreciate that very much.\nBLITZER: Great stuff. John Berman, excellent work. I loved it. All right, thanks so much. Important note to all of our viewers, you can catch John along with Zoraida Sambolin every morning on \"EARLY START\" right here at CNN.

Mitt Romney himself is making the political Olympic analogy touting his experience organizing the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002. Listen to what he tells CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview in London that will air later tonight.\nROMNEY: The country is in need of a turnaround. The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.\nBLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on \"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT\" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.\nBERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.\nBERMAN: Pole vault, the latest \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead.

President Trump's recent back and forth with the father of a UCLA basketball player has revived questions about the president and race. The president was outraged that this father LaVar Ball refused to thank him for helping free his son LiAngelo Ball from custody, one of three athletes arrested for shoplifting. The president called LaVar Ball, quote, an ungrateful fool and the poor man's version of Don King without hair all over Twitter who could have spent, quote, the next five to ten years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you. So adding to that today, the ghost writer to the president's best- seller Art of the Deal is saying this about why the president crossed the line to cut down LaVar Ball.\nTONY SCHWARTZ, TRUMP'S GHOSTWRITER FOR ART OF THE DEAL: I think Trump is half awed and half frightened by black people and his only way of dealing with them is to attack them. And on the other hand, I think he has a zero tolerance for any criticism of any kind.\nBALDWIN: Let's start there. CNN political commentators Paris Dennard and Sally Kohn are with me. Happy thanksgiving first and foremost to both of you. Paris, you heard Tony Schwartz saying the president is half awed and half frightened by black people. What do you think that means and would you like to comment on that?\nPARIS DENNARD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORS: I mean, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving. I think Tony is ridiculous in his statements. I find it interesting that after this man becomes the president of the United States is when he decides to really become so negative, rude and political. But the fact that President Trump is awed by African-American people is not a bad thing. I think a lot of people are awed by successful groups of people, people who are accomplished. I think the president likes and is awed by a lot of people who are successful, who are -- who are the best at their game, who strive and overcome obstacles and become number one, who are winners.\nBALDWIN: Do we think that's how Tony Schwartz meant it?\nDENNARD: I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's how Tony Schwartz meant it. I doubt it. But that's how the president is. I've interacted with him many, many times. I've seen him with large groups of black people and that is not a man who is by any means frightened by African-Americans. I think that notion is absurd and I think it's highly offensive to have him equate that to this man. If you are a racist, you don't appoint or put the first African- American woman to be the -- your press secretary to the campaign. If you are a racist or you're afraid of black people, you don't invite the largest number of HBCU presidents and chancellors in your office to meet with them if you're afraid of black people or if you're somehow a racist. This is not something that is racist or someone who is a scared of black people does. And so I think these comments just reinforce a false narrative about this president because we were all surprised to see the president did so well with the African-American community. He has a long positive history with the black community going back for many, many years, many decades and it is continuing now with his agenda, especially when you look at the tax cut plan that will impact small business owners, as well as middle class Americans, which is a lot of African-Americans just like myself. So this is something that is unfortunate and I don't know why Tony is doing it, but I guess it's just for him to get more publicity off the back of the president of the United States.\nBALDWIN: OK. Paris, that's how you see it. Sally Kohn, how do you see it?\nSALLY KOHN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm glad Paris brought up a false narrative. I agree there is a false narrative here.

But the fact that President Trump is awed by African-American people is not a bad thing. I think a lot of people are awed by successful groups of people, people who are accomplished. I think the president likes and is awed by a lot of people who are successful, who are -- who are the best at their game, who strive and overcome obstacles and become number one, who are winners.\nBALDWIN: Do we think that's how Tony Schwartz meant it?\nDENNARD: I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's how Tony Schwartz meant it. I doubt it. But that's how the president is. I've interacted with him many, many times. I've seen him with large groups of black people and that is not a man who is by any means frightened by African-Americans. I think that notion is absurd and I think it's highly offensive to have him equate that to this man. If you are a racist, you don't appoint or put the first African- American woman to be the -- your press secretary to the campaign. If you are a racist or you're afraid of black people, you don't invite the largest number of HBCU presidents and chancellors in your office to meet with them if you're afraid of black people or if you're somehow a racist. This is not something that is racist or someone who is a scared of black people does. And so I think these comments just reinforce a false narrative about this president because we were all surprised to see the president did so well with the African-American community. He has a long positive history with the black community going back for many, many years, many decades and it is continuing now with his agenda, especially when you look at the tax cut plan that will impact small business owners, as well as middle class Americans, which is a lot of African-Americans just like myself.

Here's a look at some members of the financial meltdown hall of shame. One of the first banks to tumble was Lehman Brothers, and along with it -- Lehman Brothers, rather, along with it CEO Dick Fuld. Fuld testified on the Hill trying to explain the bank's demise and his $480 million earnings over the past eight years. Unlike Lehman, AIG got a government bailout. AIG execs spent more than $300,000 for a weekend retreat less than one week after the government gave the company $85 billion. And the big three with the CEOs of Ford, GM and Chrysler came to Washington hat in hand asking for a bailout. They did it in style. Each flew in on his own jet and took a beating for it on Capitol Hill, so much so that the next time they arrived, a couple of them were in hybrids, another one in a very high-mileage cars. So they got the message.\nCHETRY: Well, they're cutting checks with your money, bonuses in the billions, millions for stuff they don't need. When is the pushback going to happen? Well, maybe it's already started. Carol Costello joins us live from Washington. Hi, Carol.\nCAROL COSTELLO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kiran. I'm looking at the glass half full this morning. That wall of shame was a good thing because, you know, it's power to the people time. And the battle that pitted Main Street versus Wall Street, Main Street now has the upper hand. Really? Shame works.\nCOSTELLO (voice-over): Forget about Congress re-regulating Wall Street. Turns out a little public flogging is pretty darn effective. Shame works. From public demonstrations --\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's disgusting.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all toxic.\nCOSTELLO: To scathing public indictments.\nCAMPBELL BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Who is in charge of this process? Who is watching the banks? Who is demanding accountability?\nCOSTELLO: Right now, it's you, Main Street. When word got out ex- Merrill Lynch boss John Thain spent $1.2 million to renovate his office, public outrage was so extreme, even the man who thought it was OK to pay $35,000 for a toilet finally got it.\nJOHN THAIN, FMR. CEO, MERRILL LYNCH: It is clear to me, in today's world, that it was a mistake. I apologize for spending that money on those -- on those things. And I will make it right. I will reimburse the company for all of those costs.\nCOSTELLO: And he didn't even have to be publicly berated by Congress as so many others have, like ex-Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo whose company sunk in the subprime mess and cost taxpayers millions in bailout money.\nANGELO MOZILO, CEO COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: I waive any and all severance, in addition canceled the consulting agreement included in my contract.\nCOSTELLO: Public advocacy groups feel positively vindicated.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Totally. I mean, well, but we have before. This is not the first time. But we do feel vindicated.\nCOSTELLO: Keep in mind these failed CEOs don't legally have to give up their cushy perks even if their companies benefit from the $700 billion bailout. But some experts say shame is proving to be a most effective weapon.\nBRAD GOOGINS, BOSTON COLLEGE CTR. FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP: Change really happens from the inside out, in any institution, whether it's the churches or corporations or whatever. And it really -- you really need to have an outside agitation to open this up.\nCOSTELLO: Citibank certainly felt that. When word leaked out it was going to spend $42 million for a brand, spanking new corporate jet, people complained so loudly, Citibank got a call from the Obama administration. What did Citibank do? Well, no more new jet.\nCOSTELLO: That's for sure. Now, it's not to say experts don't think accountability shouldn't be part of the bailout. It absolutely should, or that Wall Street doesn't need a regulation makeover. It just means the tone has already changed. And the fact Main Street won't put up with it anymore gives the president and Congress tremendous power over Wall Street -- Kiran.\nCHETRY: All right. Some would say finally, right?\nCOSTELLO: I know. Yes! Power to the people.\nCHETRY: Carol, thanks.\nROBERTS: It was trampled by roughly four million feet and covered in 130 tons of trash on inauguration day, but the National Mall will have to wait for a facelift.

The gun industry makes weapons. The National Rifle Association is a leading voice for gun rights. They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?\nPAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.\nPAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks very much.\nPAUL BARRETT: My pleasure.

They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?\nPAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.\nPAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system.

They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?\nPAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?\nPAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.\nPAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them.

It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks very much.\nPAUL BARRETT: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This is NPR News.", "model_summary": ["The gun industry is not always in agreement with the National Rifle Association (NRA) on fighting changes in gun laws.", "The NRA sets the terms of the debate, and while the gun industry may cringe at some of the NRA's extreme stances, they do not take action against them due to fear of consumer boycotts organized by the NRA."], "label": [0, 1], "source": "mediasum_test"}

That's where we'll begin this hour's coverage. Michael Okwu joins us with more on that -- Michael.\nMICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.\nMAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.\nOKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.\nBROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?\nOKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room. And that's going to be going on for the better part of this afternoon -- Aaron.\nBROWN: Michael, thank you. Michael Okwu on the CBS story. On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.\nJUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Good afternoon, Aaron.

That's where we'll begin this hour's coverage. Michael Okwu joins us with more on that -- Michael.\nMICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.\nMAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.\nOKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.\nBROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?\nOKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room. And that's going to be going on for the better part of this afternoon -- Aaron.\nBROWN: Michael, thank you. Michael Okwu on the CBS story. On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.\nJUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Good afternoon, Aaron.

And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.\nOKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.\nBROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?\nOKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room. And that's going to be going on for the better part of this afternoon -- Aaron.\nBROWN: Michael, thank you. Michael Okwu on the CBS story. On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.\nJUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: Good afternoon, Aaron. The numbers keep climbing. By my count, we're now over 40 with this number -- with this new announcement coming out of New Jersey. And again, CNN hasn't confirmed that.

The Navy has identified three sailors who have been missing since their plane crashed off the coast of Japan Wednesday. Here are their faces. It comes after they notified families that search-and-rescue efforts ended. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. Polo, tell us about these three young men.\nPOLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the personal side of these heroes. The Navy had been holding off releasing information until they could notify families. Today, this information released by the government. I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to \"USS Ronald Reagan,\" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.\nCABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?\nSANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the \"USS McCain\" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, \"USS Fitzgerald\" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, \"avoidable,\" and also the result of, quote, \"numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,\" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.\nCABRERA: Polo Sandoval, thank you.\nSANDOVAL: Thanks, Ana.\nCABRERA: Infighting in the Trump administration is threatening to overshadow a major global summit. State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?\nMICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, \"They,\" meaning Tillerson and staff, \"won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka.\" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, \"Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump.\" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, \"The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters.\" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either. Michelle Kosinski, CNN, Washington.\nCABRERA: Michelle, thanks. \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" that's the word from President Trump after saying he passed on an offer to be \"Time\" magazine Person of the Year.

State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?\nMICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, \"They,\" meaning Tillerson and staff, \"won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka.\" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, \"Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump.\" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, \"The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters.\" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either.

I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to \"USS Ronald Reagan,\" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.\nCABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?\nSANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the \"USS McCain\" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, \"USS Fitzgerald\" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, \"avoidable,\" and also the result of, quote, \"numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,\" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.\nCABRERA: Polo Sandoval, thank you.\nSANDOVAL: Thanks, Ana.\nCABRERA: Infighting in the Trump administration is threatening to overshadow a major global summit. State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?\nMICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, \"They,\" meaning Tillerson and staff, \"won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka.\" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, \"Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump.\" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, \"The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters.\" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either.

It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, \"They,\" meaning Tillerson and staff, \"won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka.\" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, \"Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump.\" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, \"The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters.\" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either. Michelle Kosinski, CNN, Washington.\nCABRERA: Michelle, thanks. \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" that's the word from President Trump after saying he passed on an offer to be \"Time\" magazine Person of the Year. But the publication says that's not true.

So Phil, sometimes the Russians retaliate for these things. In the past, they haven't. How concerned are Russian officials now that the U.S. is just going to retaliate for this retaliation?\nPHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia is saying Michelle that the ball is in your court to the United States because they have chosen to match those expulsions as you detailed there, match the closure of the consulate -- in this case, Saint Petersburg. They believe that's the reasonable response but they say that they will take more action against the United States if the U.S. acts against Russia's interests any further. And the U.S., of course, has said well, we reserve the right to take further actions as well. So it remains to be seen if this draws a line under this current round of tit for tat diplomatic expulsions of whether there is still more action to be seen. But it reinforces what we've come to realize is that this is a historic low in relations between Russia and the United States. Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself. There is still a belief here that President Trump would improve relations with Russia if he were allowed to, but Russian officials believe that he is held back -- restricted by an anti- Russian political class in the United States -- Michelle.\nKOSINSKI: Yes, this has been a difficult back-and-forth.

The Haitians were rounded up yesterday after many of them jumped from a packed wooden boat into the surf off of Key Biscayne. Immigration authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, as Susan Candiotti reports now live from Miami. Susan, it was a wild scene to watch as it developed.\nSUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was. A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way.

You can.\nCANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants.

Immigration authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, as Susan Candiotti reports now live from Miami. Susan, it was a wild scene to watch as it developed.\nSUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was. A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami.

And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants.

A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.\nREP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.\nBUSH: Congresswoman, I appreciate it.\nQUESTION: I love them.\nBUSH: I respect your position.\nQUESTION: Please, call him, governor, and ask him to please -- you can do it.\nBUSH: Thank you.\nQUESTION: We can't do it. The Congress can't do it. We tried our best. We can't do it. If you call him...\nBUSH: You know, we worked together in 1998 to change the immigration laws. With your leadership, that occurred to provide for more just treatment of Haitians. My position is, as I stated, if people have a well-founded fear of persecution, they should be allowed into the community, out of Krome and they should be able to pursue those remedies through administrative...\nQUESTION: Tell your brother they can be released right now. You can.\nCANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again. And not a good time, certainly, for Governor Jeb Bush during his re-election campaign.\nSAVIDGE: That's what I was going to ask you about. You mention the issue of timing here. Jeb Bush in a very tight race and now this literally lands on his doorstep. What are the potential pitfalls for him?\nCANDIOTTI: Reporter: well, certainly there could be major pitfalls for him in certain segments of the community. Those people who think that these migrants are being treated unfairly might decide to take up this issue and, you know, go against Governor Jeb Bush at the election polls. We have not heard yet, to the best of my knowledge, from his opponent, Democrat Jim McBride, who is running against Governor Jeb Bush. So we'll wait to see what happens as the day goes on.\nSAVIDGE: We certainly will. Susan Candiotti reporting to us from Miami. Thank you very much.

Just days after Congressman Ron DeSantis was accused of using a racist term, the \"Washington Post\" reports that DeSantis spoke at multiple racially charged events, this dating back to 2013. At these conferences, you'd hear hundreds of people, many of the speakers right-wing speakers, but also some of them known racists, bigots, Milo Yiannopoulos, Sebastian Gorka, who's had anti-Muslim positions. CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, joins me now. So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.\nJOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to \"monkey up the state.\" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the \"Washington Post\" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.\nSCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.\nJOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.\nSCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.\nJOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.\nSCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.\nJOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.\nSCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us. That is it for me today, Jim Sciutto, sitting in for Wolf. NEWSROOM with Brooke Baldwin starts right now.\nBROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Hi, there. I'm Brooke Baldwin. Thank you so much for being with me. We are minutes away from the first White House briefing in nearly three weeks. It comes as President Trump claims the White House is a smooth-running machine, despite the fact that his own vice president has offered to take a lie detector test. It's to prove he did not write that withering \"New York Times\" opinion piece, slamming the president, and as administration officials try to figure out which one of their own is not telling the truth. The president is calling Bob Woodward a liar. The acclaimed journalist, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist of Watergate fame, debuts his Trump tell-all, \"Fear\" -- the name of his book -- tomorrow. And the president is discrediting Woodward's account of an administration in an unprecedented crisis. Trump tweeted, the Woodward book is a, quote, \"scam,\" and a \"joke\" that should not be taken with a grain of salt. And here is what he says about Woodward. Trump cites Savannah Guthrie, the host of the \"Today\" show, who interviewed Woodward this morning. Quote, \"It is mostly anonymous sources in here. Why should anyone trust you? General Mattis, General Kelly said it's not true.\" Trump then writes, quote, \"Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the midterms.

Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to \"monkey up the state.\" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the \"Washington Post\" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.\nSCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.\nJOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.\nSCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.\nJOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.\nSCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.\nJOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.\nSCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us.

Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to \"monkey up the state.\" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the \"Washington Post\" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.\nSCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.\nJOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.\nSCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.\nJOHNS: Right.\nSCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.\nJOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.\nSCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.\nJOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.\nSCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us.

Our Randi Kaye breaks it down.\nDONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It is Melania.\nRANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The shot across the bow came from Ivana Trump on \"Good Morning America\" this morning.\nIVANA TRUMP, FORMER WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: I have the direct numbers to White House but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, because I'm basically first Trump wife, OK. I'm first lady.\nKAYE (voice-over): As you might imagine, Ivana calling herself the first lady didn't sit so well with the real first lady.

She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.\" The statement went on to say, \"There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. This is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise.\" That statement certainly a different tone than we heard from Melania Trump back in 2005.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know his exes?\nMELANIA TRUMP, UNITED STATES FIRST LADY: Yes.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get along with them?\nM.

She is the mother of the president's three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric who would later become his second wife. Over the weekend, Ivana told CBS she doesn't speak to Marla Maples but that she gets along with Melania Trump, explaining her reasoning this way.\nI.

TRUMP: I was just offered to be American ambassador to Czech Republic. And Donald told me said, Ivana, if you want it, I give it to you. But I like my freedom, OK.

She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.\" The statement went on to say, \"There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex.

While the Pyongyang government aims angry words at the United States, the Bush administration is sticking to plans of diplomacy. We check in with senior White House correspondent John King -- John.\nJOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.\nSEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.\nKING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.\nKING: The Bush administration maintains it is confident all of this can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy. For now though, the Bush administration's direct diplomacy is aimed at not at North Korea, but at South Korea. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly is in Seoul, South Korea for talks with South Korean officials including South Korea's president elect. There's been some criticism of the administration from that key ally, from Seoul. In Seoul, they believe the Bush administration is taking too hard of a line when it comes to North Korea. Now, North Korean officials did met with a former Clinton administration diplomat, Bill Richardson, now the governor of New Mexico, over the weekend. Those North Korean officials, we are told, told Governor Richardson they would like to have meetings with Bush administration officials as soon as possible at the United Nations in New York. Senior administration officials telling us today there are no talks scheduled. They do not rule them out, though. Perhaps some contact in the near future, we are told, to watch for, but the administration holding to this bottom line.

We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\nREP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.\nBLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.\nBLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.\nBLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.\nBLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.\nBLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: \"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.\nBLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.\nBLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.\nBLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?", "model_summary": ["Congressman Krishnamoorthi believes that documents subpoenaed from Giuliani should be reviewed before deciding whether to call him as a witness.", "He wants to see those documents before examining Giuliani's live testimony."], "label": [0, 0], "source": "mediasum_test"}

We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\nREP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.\nBLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.\nBLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.\nBLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.\nBLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.\nBLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: \"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.\nBLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know.

I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.\nBLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: \"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.\nBLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.\nBLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.\nBLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior.

The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections.

We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\nREP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.\nBLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.\nBLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.\nBLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.\nBLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.\nBLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: \"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.\nBLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.\nBLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.\nBLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine.

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair.

Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: But difficult.

And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: But difficult.

Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: But difficult. I know you don't think congratulations like married.\nSpeaker 9: There were some issue with ABC which.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Next step is oral communications where we have a limited number of speakers may address the counsel regarding any matter not on the agenda and we have 15 minutes set aside for that and any additional public comment that doesn't happen in those 15 minutes will happen later in the agenda. So do we have any speakers?\nSpeaker 1: We have three.\nSpeaker 0: Three. So with three speakers you will each get 3 minutes. You never have to feel like you have to use all 3 minutes. But any. Would you want to call our speakers?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Pat Potter Mackenzie. Tap and simmer.\nSpeaker 3: You don't know how tempted I am to continue my conversation on the car, but I won't.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not on the agenda.\nSpeaker 3: It's not on me anyway. I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic. But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big.

Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019.

They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary.

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking.

I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.\nSpeaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this.

I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public.

And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village.

I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public.

Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this.

Item six, click or read item six.\nSpeaker 4: This is a report from the city manager with the recommendation to authorize the city manager execute documents with Global Green for professional technical assistance to conduct a sustainable neighborhood assessment for the historic Virginia Village Market Street Neighborhood District eight.\nSpeaker 3: Straws.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.\nSpeaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this. My office and you can count on my full participation in my office is full participation in this assessment process can make it successful.

Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one.

I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.\nSpeaker 3: Streets and.\nSpeaker 1: Roads.\nSpeaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.\nSpeaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.\nSpeaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere.

SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.\nSpeaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.\nSpeaker 7: Be.\nSpeaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.\nSpeaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.\nSpeaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?\nSpeaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.\nSpeaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.\nSpeaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.\nSpeaker 3: Streets and.\nSpeaker 1: Roads.\nSpeaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.\nSpeaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.\nSpeaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.\nSpeaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive.

Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.\nSpeaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang.\nSpeaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.\nSpeaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.\nSpeaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.\nSpeaker 7: Be.\nSpeaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.\nSpeaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.\nSpeaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?\nSpeaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.\nSpeaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.\nSpeaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.\nSpeaker 3: Streets and.\nSpeaker 1: Roads.\nSpeaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.\nSpeaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.\nSpeaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere.

Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.\nSpeaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.\nSpeaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter.

Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?\nSpeaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.\nSpeaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period.

It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services.

I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.\nSpeaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?\nSpeaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.\nSpeaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out.

But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period.

He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?\nSpeaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.\nSpeaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.\nSpeaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well. So with that, I will move approval of item five after recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for a 12 month term in an amount not to exceed $300,000.\nSpeaker 0: We have a second.\nSpeaker 3: Second.

That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.\nSpeaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well. So with that, I will move approval of item five after recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for a 12 month term in an amount not to exceed $300,000.\nSpeaker 0: We have a second.\nSpeaker 3: Second.

Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.\nSpeaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.\nSpeaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?\nSpeaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.\nSpeaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.\nSpeaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.\nSpeaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no.

I just want to enter into the record the names of eight great young men who did a variety of community services towards earning their eagle Eagle Scout honor. And I just want to say that on June 26, on behalf of mayor, as he Ashcraft, I attended the Eagle Court of Honor that was held in the afternoon, Saturday afternoon.\nSpeaker 3: At Franklin.\nSpeaker 2: Park, where eight young Alameda INS were given. They had earned the Eagle rank. As a result, a variety of of community activities. I just wanted.\nSpeaker 3: For the record to enter their names.\nSpeaker 2: In and I hope that we make a practice of this.\nSpeaker 3: Going forward.\nSpeaker 2: These eight individuals are Henry Bank. Terry Banchory. Brendan Cook. Jonathan Hill dress. Andrew Jurek and his brother Eric Jurek, Zachary Quayle, Tibor Thompson and Vander von Stroheim. All of these individuals had to do a minimum of 25 community activities. And one of them, Jonathan Hildreth, did as much as I think it was, 45. So they did a lot of great things on behalf of the community in earning their Eagle Scout badge. And I believe our mayor has some experience in dealing with Eagle Scouts.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember de. And I really did appreciate you attending that Eagle Code of honor. I loved to attend them, but I just had a conference and couldn't be there. And it is really special. And yes, my son Cole is an Eagle Scout from Troop 89. But and I think, if I recall correctly from the emails, some of these young men would have gotten this award last year, but it was in the midst of COVID and so they couldn't meet. So it was kind of a combined combined group, but all really hardworking individuals and and I really appreciate you attending for me and I know you enjoyed it. Yeah, go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: If I could just say one more quick thing. And that was Boy Scout Troop.\nSpeaker 3: 73 in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Thank you. Councilmember Harris, Spencer James, for your handout. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: I I'd like to share that this Saturday, the 24th from 6 to 10 p.m. is Relay for Life at.\nSpeaker 1: Lydecker.\nSpeaker 0: Park. And they didn't have it last year, as far as I know. So for those of you that are supportive, it's because cancer doesn't sleep, that they do it annually as a reminder and just support those with cancer and survivors. And as we pass, the second point I wanted to share is I serve on the airport noise forum and they have actually created an app that you can use to report loud noises from planes to make it easier. If you go to the website, fly quiet. Okay. Okay. Dot com and scroll down. You'll see an app that you can load and then it's much easier to report the noise. And then finally, I wanted to share that this live Saturday at Nob Hill, there was the Boy Scout. Nathaniel Basco had come up with his Eagle Scout project, which is a piano for the community to share. It'll be available for three weeks at our side of Nob Hill. Then after that, I think it's going to be moved to a permanent location. And I want to also recognize Deirdre Freeman, the local artist who painted it for the project. So you're all welcome to go out there and play the piano. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And thank you for reminding the community about Relay for Life this Saturday later carpark.

And I just want to say that on June 26, on behalf of mayor, as he Ashcraft, I attended the Eagle Court of Honor that was held in the afternoon, Saturday afternoon.\nSpeaker 3: At Franklin.\nSpeaker 2: Park, where eight young Alameda INS were given. They had earned the Eagle rank. As a result, a variety of of community activities. I just wanted.\nSpeaker 3: For the record to enter their names.\nSpeaker 2: In and I hope that we make a practice of this.\nSpeaker 3: Going forward.\nSpeaker 2: These eight individuals are Henry Bank. Terry Banchory. Brendan Cook. Jonathan Hill dress. Andrew Jurek and his brother Eric Jurek, Zachary Quayle, Tibor Thompson and Vander von Stroheim. All of these individuals had to do a minimum of 25 community activities. And one of them, Jonathan Hildreth, did as much as I think it was, 45. So they did a lot of great things on behalf of the community in earning their Eagle Scout badge. And I believe our mayor has some experience in dealing with Eagle Scouts.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember de. And I really did appreciate you attending that Eagle Code of honor. I loved to attend them, but I just had a conference and couldn't be there. And it is really special. And yes, my son Cole is an Eagle Scout from Troop 89. But and I think, if I recall correctly from the emails, some of these young men would have gotten this award last year, but it was in the midst of COVID and so they couldn't meet. So it was kind of a combined combined group, but all really hardworking individuals and and I really appreciate you attending for me and I know you enjoyed it. Yeah, go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: If I could just say one more quick thing. And that was Boy Scout Troop.\nSpeaker 3: 73 in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Thank you. Councilmember Harris, Spencer James, for your handout. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: I I'd like to share that this Saturday, the 24th from 6 to 10 p.m. is Relay for Life at.\nSpeaker 1: Lydecker.\nSpeaker 0: Park. And they didn't have it last year, as far as I know. So for those of you that are supportive, it's because cancer doesn't sleep, that they do it annually as a reminder and just support those with cancer and survivors. And as we pass, the second point I wanted to share is I serve on the airport noise forum and they have actually created an app that you can use to report loud noises from planes to make it easier. If you go to the website, fly quiet. Okay. Okay. Dot com and scroll down. You'll see an app that you can load and then it's much easier to report the noise. And then finally, I wanted to share that this live Saturday at Nob Hill, there was the Boy Scout. Nathaniel Basco had come up with his Eagle Scout project, which is a piano for the community to share. It'll be available for three weeks at our side of Nob Hill. Then after that, I think it's going to be moved to a permanent location. And I want to also recognize Deirdre Freeman, the local artist who painted it for the project. So you're all welcome to go out there and play the piano. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And thank you for reminding the community about Relay for Life this Saturday later carpark.

We have the hearing and the Long Beach Airport noise ordinance next to items. So, Madam Clerk, the hearing, please.\nSpeaker 1: Hearing item one is a report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt resolution. Amending the master fee and charges schedule citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. West, who's who's doing this?\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Staff report will be given by Linda Tatum.\nSpeaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project. And we can respond to any questions you have.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I got a motion in a second. Let me just do is there any public comment first seen a public comment?

Staff report will be given by Linda Tatum.\nSpeaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals.

Conclude the public hearing and adopt resolution. Amending the master fee and charges schedule citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. West, who's who's doing this?\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Staff report will be given by Linda Tatum.\nSpeaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project. And we can respond to any questions you have.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I got a motion in a second. Let me just do is there any public comment first seen a public comment? Councilor Pearce.\nSpeaker 6: I just want to say great job staff are really tackling how to reduce those costs in a creative way.

Beck.\nSpeaker 1: This is a quick one.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.\nSpeaker 1: Will give.\nSpeaker 9: The police.\nSpeaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.\nSpeaker 1: Bike theft problem head.\nSpeaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments.

Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.\nSpeaker 1: Speak about this?\nSpeaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.\nSpeaker 1: This is a quick one.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.\nSpeaker 1: Will give.\nSpeaker 9: The police.\nSpeaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.\nSpeaker 1: Bike theft problem head.\nSpeaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie.

But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes.

If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes.

We're going to go ahead and move on to item 12, please. Just the next item on the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.\nSpeaker 1: Speak about this?\nSpeaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.\nSpeaker 1: This is a quick one.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.\nSpeaker 1: Will give.\nSpeaker 9: The police.\nSpeaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.\nSpeaker 1: Bike theft problem head.\nSpeaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie.

But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action. Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.

All bills introduced March 21st, 2016.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. So all three of these bills are basically giving the mayor the authority to implement a collective bargaining agreement between three different union bodies. All three of these agreements were established within the parameters established by the Seattle councils, the City Council's Labor Relations Committee. So the first one is an agreement between the public service and industrial employees. Local 1239. That agreement will last till the end of December 2018. And I should probably should have said that I am filling in for Councilmember Burgess in his absence on this legislation. That particular agreement with one, two, three nine affects up to 125 regular sitting employees and up to 225 active temporary employees. The second counts, Bill 118646 is between the city and the Teamsters local union. 117 And I think all of you are familiar with 117 and the agreement affects up to 15 regular city employees and up to 200 active temporary employees.

So all three of these bills are basically giving the mayor the authority to implement a collective bargaining agreement between three different union bodies. All three of these agreements were established within the parameters established by the Seattle councils, the City Council's Labor Relations Committee. So the first one is an agreement between the public service and industrial employees. Local 1239. That agreement will last till the end of December 2018. And I should probably should have said that I am filling in for Councilmember Burgess in his absence on this legislation. That particular agreement with one, two, three nine affects up to 125 regular sitting employees and up to 225 active temporary employees. The second counts, Bill 118646 is between the city and the Teamsters local union. 117 And I think all of you are familiar with 117 and the agreement affects up to 15 regular city employees and up to 200 active temporary employees.

Well, I don't have any particular interest in the outcome. I'm more concerned with the process. The item has a letter from an attorney representing a company that has assessed the situation and feels that it. I'm not sure if it's illegal or unwise or whatever, but there is a challenge to the proceeding and it would seem to me that we should hear from the city manager in writing and the city attorney in writing to determine whether there's any validity to the objection that's been filed. Like I said, I don't care how it comes out. I just think that it since a legal challenge is being raised, that we should get response from our city staff . Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And I will just say not that this Q&A, but just an observation that this is final passage of an ordinance as a second reading. And this item was before the council at the last council meeting and fully deliberated and voted upon at that time. Do we have any further speakers on this item? Public speakers, Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 1: We have none.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then anything further from the council saying then maybe we have a roll.\nSpeaker 0: Call vote, please.\nSpeaker 1: Do you have a motion in the Second Amendment?\nSpeaker 2: I was doing it backwards. We would have gotten around to the immersion in the vice mayor is second from. Councilmember Vela second. Right. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Again. Councilmember de fag? Yes. Next light. Hi, Odie.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Vella. Yes, Mayor. As the Ashcroft I carries by five eyes.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you very much. So with that, we have concluded the consent calendar, and now we move to the regular calendar, regular agenda.\nSpeaker 1: Exchange, the adoption of resolutions, reappointing Thomas Saxby as a member of the Historical Advisory Board, reappointing Adam Gillet, and appointing a Tierney stringer as members of the Public Art Commission, reappointing Gerald 70 as a member of the Public Utilities Board, and appointing Samantha Soules as a member of the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 2: And approval he is second. Okay. Do we have any comments? And I just want to comment. I said I think I said this when I introduced these names of these individuals last week, that I am just overwhelmed and so heartened and gratified. And I know council would share my sentiments with the quantity and the quality of applicants we're getting. And I'm talking to our different staff who staffs our different boards and commissions. And we think it's a combination of, you know, it's COVID 19. People are working from home, so maybe they have a little more time to focus on some local issues. But I think with all the layers of issues we've been dealing with since the spring, people have really focused on how can I make a difference? And one of the things I love hearing when I'm interviewing and I always conduct the interviews with whoever the city staff is who staffs that Border Commission.

I support the concept in chief and I've studied the plan for doing it and moving forward in this first phase.\nSpeaker 0: And I think it makes it eminent sense.\nSpeaker 9: And I think also the mitigation plan for this first section makes sense. I'm not sure about the mitigation for the balance of the program, but at least for this sense that makes and for this first phase, it makes sense where the problem comes up. Excuse me.\nSpeaker 4: 1/2 and. Where the problem.\nSpeaker 9: Surfaces is in the the funding of it. And I support using tidelands funds. But I think the city is going to find itself in a position of not being able to use those tidelands funds pending the given the specter of the pending indictment and arrest the Vice mayor. Commissioner. Coastal Commissioner Garcia. There are some details handed out here relative to that, and next week I'll go further into it. But I think the city needs to examine methods of financing at it other than the Tidelands Agency, because I think the requisite authorities that have the ability to do so are going to put the foot on the neck until they clean up the corruption that is set forth in not only here, but this comes on the heels, of course, as you know, the chief counsel for the Department of Boating Waterways caught the city trying to illegally use money to benefit friends of Bob Foster in the Long Beach Yacht Club. That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell. The instant issue here that brings it into focus is to S and the Marine stadium that was put forward that saying it was an epicenter of crime. The police reports clearly that are in your hands now showing that there's no crime. The building is secured at night with iron curtains, £200 each. All of both of which are chained with chain and steel at night. There is no crime. It was a ruse to make a gift to $300,000 to a few select people. That is going to hold up, I believe, the use of tidelands funds.

Break the chains.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12.

That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell.

The police reports clearly that are in your hands now showing that there's no crime. The building is secured at night with iron curtains, £200 each. All of both of which are chained with chain and steel at night. There is no crime. It was a ruse to make a gift to $300,000 to a few select people. That is going to hold up, I believe, the use of tidelands funds.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it.

Break the chains.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12.

Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you.

Mr. CODE. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 5: BURGESS, thank you very much. This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle. About 54% of Seattle households are occupied by renters. The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters. And so if this commission can help bridge that relationship, then that'll be a positive move for our city.

Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions.

Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on.

We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters.

Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions. I was grateful to co-sponsor this legislation and I'm happy to vote in favor of today. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.

This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle. About 54% of Seattle households are occupied by renters. The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters.

Before I begin, I do want to have a special thank you to Zack DeWolf for his leadership and boldness, not only for the residents of Capitol Hill and the community and all the all the projects that he works on, but also taking on a big project for all the residents of Seattle. Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions.

This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle. About 54% of Seattle households are occupied by renters. The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on.

There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters.

{"id": "cnndm_69af3b9fc4ba1fa6bd272c82d17ec318da5ff97a_missing", "doc": "(CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country.

Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

She lived in a Buddhist monastery, helped rebuild a sea wall in Fiji, then went to India and worked with Nepalese refugees. There, she met a young girl who wanted to find her family in Nepal. Doyne went with her. That's when Doyne's life took an unexpected turn. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . A decade-long civil war had just ended in the country, and Doyne witnessed its effects firsthand. She met women and children who were suffering, struggling to survive. \"It changed me,\" said Doyne, now 28. \"There were children with mallets that would go into the riverbed, pick up a big stone and break it into little, little pieces (to sell). And they were doing that all day, every day.\" Doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $5,000 she had earned babysitting. In 2006, she purchased land in Surkhet, a district in western Nepal. She worked for two years with the local community to build the Kopila Valley Children's Home. Today, Kopila -- which means \"flower bud\" in Nepali -- is home to about 50 children, from infants to teenagers. Doyne started the BlinkNow Foundation to support and grow her efforts. In 2010, the group opened its Kopila Valley School, which today educates more than 350 students. Doyne lives in Nepal year-round, traveling to the U.S. a few times a year. See more CNN Heroes . The CNN Heroes team traveled to Surkhet and talked to Doyne about her work and the community she supports. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: How does it work, raising nearly 50 kids? Maggie Doyne: It's communal living, for sure! We're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years. Everybody just pitches in and helps each other. They all have their chores. They all have their duties. And everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly. The staff at the home, we call them the aunties and the uncles. We wake up in the morning and go off to school. And then come home and do homework and eat our meals together, and everybody goes to bed at night. CNN: How does a child come to live in your home? Doyne: Our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible. In order to come into the home, you need to have lost both parents, or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect, abuse or have a parent who's incarcerated. We have to conduct a full investigation. So usually that involves going to the child's village, making calls, doing police checks, getting documentation and paperwork. We have to dig up birth certificates, death certificates, make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does. CNN: Meanwhile, you have 350 children attending your school. What is their background? Doyne: Every single year we'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants. And we choose the ones who are the most needful and really won't be in school without us. Most of them live in one room, a mud hut. A lot of them are just in survival mode. We try to relieve the burden from the family, so that the child has food, medical care, books, zero fees for education. CNN: What have you learned working with the local community in Nepal? Doyne: I learned very early on, from the beginning, that I couldn't come in and just be like, \"Here, I have a vision. This is what we're going to do.\" That doesn't work. It has to be slow; it has to be organic. And it has to come from the community and be a \"we\" thing. It's really important to me that this is a Nepali project, working for Nepal, for the community. So the faces that you see are strong Nepali women and amazing Nepali role-model men. CNN: How does the project continue to grow? Doyne: We started with the home and then school. We run the school lunch program. Then we needed to keep our kids really healthy, so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center. From there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food. And then from there we decided to start a women's center. We just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off-the-grid campus. This year we converted to solar energy. So we'll have a high school and then a day care, preschool, elementary, all the way up, and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward. It's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream. It's become a community. And I want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like. Want to get involved?

{"id": "cnndm_c811d9ae87c9bfbf31481bf8a916dc0b8e083a60_missing", "doc": "(CNN)There was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that Rolling Stone retracted on Sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed: The University of Virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus. The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called \"Jackie,\" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a \"take back the night\" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a \"bad experience.\" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being \"rapey\" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: \"UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.\" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. \"You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,\" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, \"and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus\" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. \"Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,\" he said. \"A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different.\" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. \"I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,\" Roderick said. \"... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm.\" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. \"I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'\" Roderick said. \"There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,\" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. \"Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.\"", "model_summary": ["the alleged gang rape was in 2012, and jackie says it's never expelled from a single student for sexual assault on campus.", "she says she's not to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case.", "the school has never expelled a female student for sex assault.", "the university of virginia is under investigation for the rape of sexual assault."], "label": [1, 1, 1, 0], "source": "FactCC_AggreFact"}
{"id": "cnndm_f309d4d0aabf03a015bb1125544d916aa6fe520d_missing", "doc": "(CNN)Danny Kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a Nobel Prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.  One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, \"stuff\" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck.  But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us.  For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as \"audit protection insurance,\" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the \"found money\" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital.  No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?", "model_summary": ["even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well.", "danny kahneman, my good friend and co-author who got a nobel prize in economics, once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies.", "one group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not."], "label": [0, 0, 0], "source": "FactCC_AggreFact"}

In case you're skeptical, Vox has posted a handy \"by the numbers\" for her campaign video, and there are 38 people besides Clinton in the two-minute ad. Twenty of them are women. There are three separate mentions of motherhood. This is all fine and good (and predictable) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980. And let's not overlook the fact that Clinton is in fact a woman, and that's a fine thing to celebrate. But in reality, she doesn't have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy. She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. As I've previously written, the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme: the \"war on women.\" Granted, that's not because Republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women. But it is noteworthy that Democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues (and men) crashed and burned. To wit: . In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall was nicknamed \"Mark Uterus\" for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women's reproductive issues, only to end up, according to exit polls, eight points ahead among women. His opponent, Cory Gardner, finished 17 points ahead among men. In New York, a Democratic candidate for Congress, Martha Robertson, drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a \"war on women.\" To repeat, she was a woman, a Democrat, in New York. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for Democrats' lack of popularity in the South. Not surprisingly, Southerners voted for her opponent, Bill Cassidy. In Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography. Her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by 20 points, and Davis only ended up with 47% of the women vote. Whether in Texas or Colorado, New York or Louisiana, voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren't going to be bullied into voting Democratic by false cries of sexism. But while Democrats were screaming about the Republicans' \"war on women,\" few in the media acknowledged that the Democrats' deficit among men was actually greater than the Republicans' deficit among women. Exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a 16-point margin, and women voted for Democrats by only a four-point margin. Regardless of whom Republicans run for president, Hillary Clinton will most likely get the women vote. What she needs are men. So instead of running a woman-centered campaign, she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex.", "model_summary": ["announcement/campaign ad/short says hillary clinton's campaign will make women and a woman to be a woman.", "announcement/campaign ad/short film is a video that debuted on sunday."], "label": [1, 0], "source": "FactCC_AggreFact"}

It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. \"It could have been a super low today,\" a disappointed Woods said after his round. \"All in all. It should have been two shots better.\" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible . The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. \"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.", "model_summary": ["saturday at the masters, like any pga tournament, has been dubbed `moving day 'it's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up.", "rory mcilroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable grand slam on sunday night."], "label": [0, 0], "source": "FactCC_AggreFact"}

The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June10 June - Hereford expelled from Football ConferenceAnd former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.The average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.", "model_summary": ["hereford united\\'s annual conference in hereford has come to an end-of-season conference, days after the club\\'s relegation to the national league"], "label": [1], "source": "FRANK_AggreFact"}

{"id": "xsum_34320852_BART", "doc": "The SFA's performance director has been conducting a review since taking over from Mark Wotte. Across the seven schools involved throughout Scotland, 374 children receive up to 10 hours a week specialised coaching as part of their everyday studies. \"There's been a lot of time invested in this project by a lot of people and we're looking at how we continue to improve the programme as we travel through the years,\" McClair told BBC Scotland. The project is now in its fourth year, with this year's intake of pupils the final one of the initial scheme. McClair will decide in the coming months whether it will continue in its current format once an analysis of how it is working has been concluded. Alternatives could include certificating the programme to award pupils a Higher qualification for completing the course or focusing on a smaller group of children at one single, residential campus rather than the seven schools involved just now. At the very least, the current system will continue until this year's S1 pupils have completed fourth year. Gauging its success thus far is tricky, with the oldest participants still only in S4, but McClair believes there are some good indicators. \"I think you can be encouraged by the number of young people who have been in the performance schools who have been in the younger representative squads over the last three-and-a-bit years and the evidence suggests that will continue,\" he added. \"By summertime I think it'll be a half-decent measure of the number of young boys who are being offered the opportunity to go into full-time football, although I believe that's changing a little bit in the sense that it's 16 or 17 that some clubs are looking at taking them in full-time. \"The idea's great. Many clubs in England have taken it on board - getting kids in during the day, giving them more opportunities to practise the disciplines involved in football. \"The evidence is all there that they're improving quicker than they were previously under a hybrid programme where all the coaching was taking place in the evening or at weekends.\" The other important gauge of success is academic achievement. Exam results will not be available from the SFA project until this summer, but Graeme High School in Falkirk ran a pilot scheme - of which Craig Sibbald and Celtic youngster Paul McMullan are graduates - that allows for some analysis. \"Last year we had a group of 14 or 15 and the vast majority were highly successful, able pupils, one with five Highers, two with four Highers, three with three Highers and a suite of other academic achievements,\" headteacher Lesley Carroll told BBC Scotland. \"Most of them have gone on to professional clubs but they have got a fallback position. They have been some of our top-performing academic pupils too because not only do they have to be elite athlete footballers, they have to have what the SFA would call a growth mindset. \"They're not afraid of targets, hard work, commitment, drive and confidence.\" Indeed, Carroll believes there is an argument the programme helps the performance school students achieve better results in their other subjects, though she admits no \"real forensic research has been done into that\". But it will be the level of footballing development that determines exactly how McClair and the SFA proceed in terms of their future performance strategy.", "model_summary": ["The Scottish Football Association is considering the future of its performance school programme for young footballers, according to new chief executive Martin McClair."], "label": [1], "source": "Cao22_AggreFact"}

He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister. When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura. The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio. Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters. But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign. Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free. In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq. The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair. He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\". Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\". The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire. The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival. At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor. In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture. His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%. Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers. Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson. He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas. Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers. In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value. Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe. His latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.", "model_summary": ["Boris Johnson's political career has been a roller-coaster ride of highs and lows - and now it looks like he may be about to take another step towards the top."], "label": [0], "source": "Cao22_AggreFact"}

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) An emergency exists concerning worker exposure to combustible dust explosions and fires, and there is a significant risk of death or severe injury to workers employed at facilities where combustible dusts are present. (2) Following 3 catastrophic dust explosions that killed 14 workers in 2003, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) issued a report in November 2006, which identified 281 combustible dust incidents between 1980 and 2005 that killed 119 workers and injured 718. The CSB concluded that ``combustible dust explosions are a serious hazard in American industry''. A quarter of the explosions occurred at food industry facilities, including sugar plants. (3) In November 2006, the CSB recommended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issue a standard designed to prevent combustible dust fires and explosions in general industry, based on current National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) dust explosion standards. (4) Fourteen workers were killed and more than 38 seriously injured in a catastrophic combustible dust explosion at Imperial Sugar in Port Wentworth, Georgia on February 7, 2008. (5) An investigation by the CSB found that the explosion at Imperial Sugar was fueled by a massive accumulation of sugar dust throughout the packaging building, triggering a series of secondary explosions throughout the factory. (6) The CSB's final report of September 24, 2009, regarding the Imperial Sugar Refinery explosion reiterated its previous recommendation from November 2006 that OSHA proceed expeditiously ``to promulgate a comprehensive standard to reduce or eliminate hazards from fire and explosion from combustible powders and dust''. (7) Explosions continue to injure workers and cause property damage. In the 3 years since the February 7, 2008, explosion at Imperial Sugar, there have been 24 additional combustible dust explosions or fires resulting in 4 deaths and 65 injuries to workers through February 7, 2011, according to data released by the Chemical Safety Board. (8) On October 21, 2009, OSHA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in response to the CSB's recommendation; however, a final rule will take at least 4 more years, during which it is foreseeable that additional workers will be seriously injured or killed. (9) OSHA issued a grain handling facilities standard (29 C.F.R. 1910.272) in 1987 that has proven highly effective in reducing the risk of combustible grain dust explosions, according to an OSHA evaluation. (10) No OSHA standard comprehensively addresses combustible dust explosion hazards in general industry. (11) Voluntary NFPA standards exist that, when implemented, effectively reduce the likelihood and impact of combustible dust explosions. In particular-- (A) certain requirements currently apply to existing establishments, which NFPA refers to as a ``retroactive'' application, and include hazard assessment, housekeeping, control of static electricity, control of open flames and sparks, use of certain tools, employee training, and requirements for inspection and maintenance of equipment; (B) other requirements include conventional ignition source control and dust emission control technologies, such as ventilation systems that capture fugitive dust, and enclosure of dust generating processes; (C) many employers currently implement such requirements from NFPA standards to address combustible dust hazards in the workplace; and (D) many employers maintain written combustible dust safety programs and involve employees in implementing the program, which are important aspects of a comprehensive combustible dust hazard control system. (12) Implementation of such means of hazard control is both technologically and economically feasible and would substantially reduce risks related to combustible dust fires and explosions to workers. SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF INTERIM STANDARD ON COMBUSTIBLE DUST. (a) Application and Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall promulgate an interim final standard regulating occupational exposure to combustible dust hazards. The interim final standard shall, at a minimum, apply to manufacturing, processing, blending, conveying, repackaging, and handling of combustible particulate solids and their dusts, including organic dusts (such as sugar, candy, paper, soap, and dried blood), plastics, sulfur, wood, rubber, furniture, textiles, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, fibers, dyes, coal, metals (such as aluminum, chromium, iron, magnesium, and zinc), fossil fuels, and others determined by the Secretary, but shall not apply to processes already covered by the occupational safety and health standard on grain facilities contained in section 1910.272 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations. (b) Application.--The interim final standard required under this section shall be based on those portions of the National Fire Protection Association Standards in effect on the date of enactment of this Act that-- (1) apply to existing facilities; or (2) call for source and dust emission control technologies, such as ventilation systems that capture fugitive dust, and enclosure of dust generating processes. (c) Requirements.--The interim final standard required under this section shall include the following elements: (1) Requirements for hazard assessment to identify, evaluate, and control combustible dust hazards. (2) Requirements for a written program that includes provisions for hazardous dust inspection, testing, hot work, ignition control, and housekeeping, including the frequency and method or methods used to minimize accumulations of combustible dust on ledges, floors, equipment, and other exposed surfaces. (3) Requirements for engineering controls, administrative controls, and operating procedures, including means to control fugitive dust emissions and ignition sources, and the safe use and maintenance of process equipment and dust collection systems and filters. (4) Requirements for workplace inspection and housekeeping to prevent accumulation of combustible dust in places of employment in such depths that it can present explosion, deflagration, or other fire hazards, including safe methods of dust removal. (5) Requirements for participation of employees and their representatives in hazard assessment, development of and compliance with the written program, incident investigation, and other elements of hazard management. (6) Requirements to provide written safety and health information and annual training to managers and employees and their representatives, including housekeeping procedures, hot work procedures, preventive, predictive, and periodic maintenance procedures, common ignition sources, and lock-out, tag-out procedures. (d) Applicability of Other Statutory Requirements.--The requirements applicable to occupational safety and health standards under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(b)), the requirements of chapters 5 and 6 of title 5, United States Code, and titles 2 and 42, United States Code, shall not apply to the issuance of the interim final standard required under this section. (e) Effective Date of Interim Standard.--The interim final standard shall take effect 30 days after issuance, except that such standard may include a reasonable phase-in period for implementation of required engineering controls. The interim final standard shall have the legal effect of an occupational safety and health standard, and shall apply until a final standard becomes effective under section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655). SEC. 4. FINAL STANDARD ON COMBUSTIBLE DUST. Not later than 18 months after the date on which the interim final standard is issued under section 3, the Secretary of Labor shall, pursuant to section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655), issue a proposed rule for regulating combustible dust explosions that includes the major elements contained in the interim final standard issued under section 3, and shall issue a final rule 3 years after the issuance of a proposed rule.", "model_summary": ["The Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosions and Fires Act of 2011 was created after multiple catastrophic dust explosions occurred in facilities where combustible dusts were present, resulting in the deaths of workers and property damage.", "The Act requires the Secretary of Labor to promulgate an interim final standard regulating occupational exposure to combustible dust hazards, including hazard assessments, a written program, engineering controls, workplace inspection and housekeeping, and training.", "The interim final standard applies to manufacturing, processing, blending, conveying, repackaging, and handling of combustible particulate solids and their dusts, excluding processes covered by the grain facilities standard.", "The final rule must be issued 3 years after the issuance of a proposed rule, which must be created within 18 months of the issuance of the interim final standard."], "label": [0, 0, 0, 0], "source": "billsum_zero_shot_faceval_domains"}

{"id": "32a6aca3-63d4-491b-810e-31fdcb20d87a_flant5_gen", "doc": "ischemic stroke is a major cause of neurological disability and a big burden on the family and society. regaining function can significantly reduce dependence and improve the quality of life of stroke survivors. ischemic stroke has a very complex pathophysiology. in addition to irreversible neuronal damage, ischemia also triggers cellular processes for neuronal repair involving remaining neurons. apoptosis and necrosis are two vital types of cell death in ischemic brain injury. recently, autophagic cell death has been reported as a third type of cell death in ischemic tissue. autophagy is a lysosomal pathway for recycling of organelles and long-lived proteins. in the course of autophagy, autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles, are formed to sequester cytoplasmic constituents. the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to digest the contents for recycling. physiologically, autophagy plays a key role in adapting to nutritional deprivation and eliminating aggregated proteins. however, inappropriate activation of autophagy may lead to cell death in cerebral ischemia. although it is unclear whether autophagy prevents or contributes to apoptotic cell death, the interaction between autophagy-related and apoptosis-related proteins, suggests an interplay between apoptosis and autophagy. on the other hand, stroke also induces neurogenesis. it has been reported that newborn neurons can contribute to functional recovery after stroke. interestingly, down-regulation of either autophagy or apoptosis can increase neurogenesis after stroke. therefore, the functional outcome may be resulted from a complex interplay among autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis following cerebral ischemia. previously, we and others have demonstrated that physical exercise can improve functional recovery after stroke. the protective effects of physical exercise are partially associated with enhancement of neurogenesis and attenuation of apoptosis. it is necessary to investigate the effects of physical exercise on neuronal proliferation and death. although it has been proved that physical exercise can mitigate autophagy and enhance functional recovery after myocardial infarction in animals, the role of autophagy in exercise-induced functional recovery after stroke remains elusive. growth factors such as igf- also have benefitial effects on exercise-induced functional recovery in cerebral ischemia. it is also reported that up-regulation of igf- expression mitigates autophagy in some conditions. consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of physical exercise on ischemia-induced autophagy, apoptosis, neurogenesis and igf- in the peri-infarct region after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. in this study, we demonstrated that physical exercise could mitigate autophagosome accumulation, attenuate apoptosis, promote neurogenesis and igf- expression in the peri-infarct region, thus improving the functional recovery. physical exercise improved functional recovery the effects of physical exercise on neurological function were evaluated using modified neurological severity score scale. the mnss were ±, ± and ± at and days in the exercise groups after mcao, respectively. in contrast, the mnss were ±, ±, ± and ± at and days in the control group after mcao, respectively. the repeated measures anova revealed a significant main effect of mnss at and days, an significant interaction between treatment effects and time effects at and days and a significant time effect at and days. but there was no significant difference between two groups at days after mcao. non-parametric analysis revealed that the mnss values at or days were much lower than those in control group at days, indicating a spontaneous recovery after mcao. there was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure, rectal temperature, arterial blood gas values, glucose levels and body weight. physical exercise reduced the volume of the infarct area the relative infarct volumes were %± % at days in basal control group after mcao. the relative infarct volumes were %± % and %± % in physical exercise and control group at days after mcao. the relative infarct volumes were %± % and %± % at and days in the physical exercise group after mcao, respectively. in contrast, the relative infarct volumes were %± % and % ± % at and days in the control group after mcao, respectively. in control group, the infarct volumes were significantly smaller at and days than those at days after mcao, indicating a spontaneous recovery after mcao. compared with control group, physical exercise significantly reduced the infarct volumes at and days but not at days after mcao. interestingly, the attenuation of mnss was positively correlated with the reduction of infarct volumes. these findings suggest that physical exercise reduces brain damage and improves neurological function. physical exercise mitigated autophagosomes accumulation and attenuated apoptosis in the peri-infarct region to examine the involvement of autophagosomes, immunostaining was performed using an antibody against lc there are two forms of lc3—the cytosolic and membrane-bound forms. upon induction of autophagy, the cytosolic lc3-i is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form lc3-ii and the latter then translocates to the newly formed autophagosome membrane. therefore, lc staining shows a change from diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to intense punctate labelling when autophagosome formation is induced. lc staining remained diffuse within the cytoplasm in sham-operated rats or contra-lateral hemisphere. in contrast, lc staining displayed numerous punctate dots within the cytoplasm after transient mcao. lc3-immunopositive cells reached the peak in the peri-infarct region at days after mcao and decreased thereafter. there were significant differences in the number of lc3-punctate cells between control and physical exercise groups at and days, but not at days. compared with control group, physical exercise alleviated autophagy. furthermore, the number of lc3-punctate cells was positively correlated with both neurological function scores and relative infarct volumes, suggesting that activity of autophagy is associated with ischemic cellular injury. therefore, physical exercise improves functional recovery may, at least partially, through inhibition of autophagy. the tunel-positive cells were rare in the contra-lateral hemisphere and sham-operated group after mcao. in contrast, the tunel-positive cells were evident in peri-infarct region at days and then decreased gradually from to days. there were significant differences in the number of tunel-positive cells between physical exercise group and control group at and days, suggesting that physical exercise reduces apoptotic cell death. to further investigate the demise of lc3-positive cells, double-labeled immunofluorescence staining was performed using antibodies against lc and tunel. notably, double staining showed that % of lc3-positive cells were also stained with tunel. lc3/tunel double-positive cells were significantly lower in physical exercise groups than in control group. moreover, the induction of lc3-punctate cells was positively correlated with the number of tunel-positive cells. physical exercise increased the expression of igf- and promoted neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region igf-1-positive cells were evident on ischemic side but were rarely detected on the contra-lateral hemisphere. there was no co-localization between igf- and lc3-ii. compared with control group, physical exercise increased the expression of igf- at all the observed time points. ki a proliferative marker, was used to evaluate neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region. at days after mcao, ki67-positive cells were obvious in the peri-infarct region, but were barely visible in the contra-lateral cerebrum and sham-operated group. the number of ki67-immunopositive cells in the peri-infarct region reached the peak at days and decreased thereafter. physical exercise significantly increased ki67-immunopositive cells in the peri-infarct region at, and days after mcao. discussion in the present study, we investigated the effects of physical exercise on autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis. we found that ischemia-induced autophagy was associated with apoptotic cell death but not with neurogenesis, suggesting a deleterious role of autophagy in brain ischemic injury. in addition to attenuating autophagy and apoptotic cell death, physical exercise also promoted igf- expression and cell proliferation, thereby improving functional recovery. the function of autophagy in exercise-mediated protection against ischemia still remains controversial. for example, in myocardial infarction, prior exercise maintains basal autophagy and protects against cardiac ischemic injury. on the other hand, post-ischemic exercise reduces the ratio of lc3ii/lc3i and improves functional recovery. it is generally believed that imbalance or excessive autophagy promotes cellular pathology and ultimately leads to cell death in cerebral ischemia. however, the relationship between autophagy and exercise-mediated neuroprotection is not clear. consistently, we found that autophagosomes were accumulated after focal cerebral ischemia. in contrast, physical exercise attenuated ischemia-induced autophagosome accumulation. the suppression of autophagy by exercise was positively associated with the recovery of neurological function and reduction of brain damage, suggesting that physical exercise may improve functional recovery from ischemic stroke, at least in part, through inhibition of autophagy. cell death, especially apoptosis, is a major contributor to neuronal damage in cerebral ischemia. the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis is very complex. autophagy can either promote or inhibit apoptosis under different conditions. interestingly, we found that tunel-positive and lc3-punctate cells were pronounced in the peri-infarct region and the number of tunel-positive cells was positively correlated with the number of lc3-punctate cells. physical exercise significantly reduced both autophagic and apoptotic cell death. given that autophagy and apoptosis can share many common death pathways. our findings suggest that autophagy may play a pathologic role in ischemic cell death whereas physical exercise may attenuate ischemia-induced brain damage through inhibition of common upstream signals for cell death. neurogenesis, particularly igf-1-mediated neurogenesis, is a major mechanism underlying beneficial effects of exercise on ischemic stroke. post-ischemic neurogenesis is a complex process involving coordination of multiple signaling pathways. it has been reported that autophagy can play opposite roles in regulating neurogenesis depending on different conditions. for example, activation of autophagy can modulate cell proliferation during neuronal development and regeneration. on the other hand, reducing autophagic activity has been shown to promote neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. in addition, igf- is also thought to have significant inhibitory actions on autophagy through activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex. consistently, exercise significantly increased the numbers of igf-1- positive cells and ki67-labeled proliferation cells. however, lc was not co-localized with either igf- or ki- indicating that autophagy may not be directly involved in ischemia-induced neurogenesis. whether igf- plays a role in exercise-induced mitigation of atuophagy needs further investigation. altogether, our results suggest that the benefit of physical exercise on functional recovery is associated with mitigation of autophagy, attenuation of apoptosis and enhancement of neurogenesis as evidenced by igf- expression and cell proliferation in the peri-infarct region after stroke.", "model_summary": ["Physical exercise mitigates autophagy, attenuates apoptosis and

{"id": "063cf922-6e0b-454e-a56f-4a31804cb9d4_flant5_gen", "doc": "the isolation of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms from clinical specimens collected from suspected patients serves as the gold standard for the proper diagnosis of tuberculosis in the laboratory. however, false-positive cultures have been reported that result from the cross-contamination of specimens via a contaminated bronchoscope or, more often, by laboratory cross-contamination. the latter situation has been reported at a frequency ranging from % to 3% of m. tuberculosis. laboratory cross-contamination should be suspected when m. tuberculosis is cultured from a smear-negative specimen processed in the same batch as a culture from a smear-positive specimen. the factors that increase the likelihood of cross-contamination include instances when only one of several specimens from the same patient is culture-positive and instances when the clinician is considering a diagnosis other than tuberculosis, which the clinician believes to be more likely based on clinical observations. such false-positives resulting from cross-contaminated specimens are disadvantageous since, besides resulting in a misdiagnosis, they result in unnecessary treatment and delay further diagnostic investigations in an effort to derive a definitive and correct diagnosis. finally, these false-positive cultures lead to an overestimation of the incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis in humans. a definitive demonstration of cross-contamination can be derived from precise molecular analyses of m. tuberculosis isolates. m. tuberculosis isolates harbouring identical genotypes are regarded as clones and are thus epidemiologically linked. the most widely used technique for determining the genotype of m. tuberculosis is a technique known as is6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. rflp analysis requires a large amount of biological material and, thus, poses a risk to laboratory workers due to the harmful nature of this pathogen. moreover, the latter method requires a substantial amount of time due to the fastidious nature of m. tuberculosis. more importantly from, a strictly technical perspective, is6110-rflp analysis does a poor job of indicating the presence of m. tuberculosis when these organisms contain only a few copies of the is sequence. recently, the variable number tandem repeat pcr-based technique and the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit technique have proven to be reliable methods for the resolution of cross-contamination events. we herein report the application of a new pcr-sequencing-based genotyping method, known as multispacer sequence typing, for determining whether specimens have been cross-contaminated with m. tuberculosis in the laboratory. case report a 60-year-old man was admitted for an examination to determine whether he had interstitial pneumonia. the patient had been previously hospitalised for two weeks at a different location with symptoms that included shortness of breath, a fever of °c, and a kg loss of weight within the past month. at the aforementioned hospital, a chest radiograph indicated the presence of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. subsequent microbiological investigations, including ziehl-neelsen staining and a pcr-based assay to test for the presence of m. tuberculosis on expectoration, indicated that there were no signs of such an infection. the patient was then transferred to our department for further evaluation. clinical examination of the patient verified both a body temperature of – °c and dyspnoea with 90% oxygen saturation under l/min oxygen. the medical history of the patient was unremarkable, except for previous treatment for arterial hypertension. the total body tomodensitometry indicated the presence of nodules in both lungs, in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and in a right axilar lymph node. the pertinent laboratory assays were performed and indicated a value of leucocytes/ml with 76% polymorphonuclear cells and platelets/ml. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was determined to be mm for the first hour. the lactate dehydrogenase level was iu/ml, the gamma gt level was iu/ml, the bilirubin concentration was μmol/l, the ast level was iu/l, and the alt level was shown to be iu/l. it was suspected that the patient had already begun to develop pulmonary tuberculosis and thus was recommended to receive anti-tuberculosis therapy since it was reported that m. tuberculosis was isolated from an expectoration that was collected days prior during the first hospital visit. due to the observation that the patient's respiratory status had worsened, the patient was admitted into an intensive care unit for a period of four days. the results of direct microscopic examinations using gram and ziehl-neelsen staining of a surgical lung biopsy were negative. this sample, cultured in bactec and in 5% blood agar in slant tubes, remained sterile after a two-month incubation period. subsequent histological examination discovered large b-cell lymphoma and further assessments confirmed that the patient had stage iv lymphoma that involved the lung, liver, and bone marrow. the patient then received the appropriate anti-lymphoma therapy. our investigation revealed isolation of a total of six m. tuberculosis strains from a laboratory that performed analyses for six different patients within a 2-week period before and after the isolation of m. tuberculosis from the index patient. all isolates were recovered from respiratory tract specimens and identified as m. tuberculosis by phenotypic methods and the etr-d sequencing method. isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received and handled on april 27th, while isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received on may 3rd, but handled for setting in culture on may 4th. isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received and handled on may 4th, while isolates tub tub and tub were recovered from specimens received and handled on may 8th. ziehl-neelsen staining was performed on all six specimens and the subsequent analyses revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli for all samples with the exception of the specimen collected from index patient c, which exhibited no acid-fast bacillus. epidemiological investigation indicated that patients a, d, and e resided in the same ward, whereas no epidemiological link was found between the other three patients, including index patient c. eight intergenic spacers were pcr amplified for each of the six m. tuberculosis isolates and yielded pcr products of the expected sizes. sequences derived from these pcr products were combined and assembled for each of the six isolates. mst analysis was completed within four working days. analysis of the sequence combinations determined three new genetic profiles, including profile st which characterized the three isolates derived from patients a, d, and e; profile st which characterized the two isolates derived from patient b and the index patient c; and profile st which was discovered in the isolate derived from patient f. these new profiles resulted from a novel combination of the following spacer alleles: the st profile combined alleles 1/mst 1/mst 1/mst 2/mst 1/mst 3/mst 4/mst and allele 4/mst13; the st profile combined alleles 1/mst 1/mst 2/mst 2/mst 1/mst 3/mst 4/mst and allele 4/mst13; and the st profile combined alleles 1/mst 1/mst 1/mst 1/mst 3/mst 3/mst 4/mst and allele 4/mst the profiles for st st and st have been added to our free and accessible mst database http://ifr timone.univ-mrs.fr/mst_mtuberculosis/mst. mst genotyping data were assumed to be authentic based on the observations that the pcr-negative controls remained negative, coupled with the observation that all pcr products were of the predicted size. moreover, analysis of the spacer sequences edited in this work identified three new profiles, clearly indicating that amplicons did not result from laboratory contamination as a consequence of previous experiments. the mst genotyping data provided evidence to support epidemiological and clinical data that confirmed laboratory cross-contamination. specifically, one profile comprised three isolates recovered from epidemiologically-linked patients, whereas a different profile characterized only one isolate from a specimen collected from an unrelated patient f. the profile st was discovered for two m. tuberculosis isolates obtained from the index patient c and one unrelated patient b. microscopic examination of a respiratory tract specimen collected from patient b indicated the presence of acid-fast bacilli, while the same analysis performed for a specimen from the respiratory tract of the index patient c showed no indication of acid-fast bacilli. both of the latter two specimens were handled in the same laboratory, on the same day, and within the same batch of sample preparations, which explains the observation that the specimen recovered from the index patient was contaminated by the specimen collected from patient b. such a situation has been previously observed in cases of laboratory cross-contamination. interestingly, the frequency of false-positive cultures has been shown to be higher for laboratories that do not process high numbers of specimens, as was the case in the present report. as an example, in the laboratory setting, cross-contamination events may occur in the safety cabinet when a smear-positive specimen is handled in parallel with a smear-negative specimen, or during the phenotypic identification of isolates during the niacin test. cross-contamination of respiratory tract specimens by the avirulent m. tuberculosis h37ra reference strain has also been reported. the mst method, which was used in this study in addition to the more commonly used vntr/miru typing method, requires a relatively small amount of sample dna from the patient. in contrast to the conventional is6110-rflp method, which requires a relatively large amount of dna, both the mst and the vntr/miru typing methods require only small dna samples as they are based on pcr amplification of selected genomic regions. the fact that such a small amount of material is handled during these aforementioned procedures is an obvious advantage, since it limits the risk of exposure of laboratory personnel to a dangerous pathogen. since the mst method is based on sequence analysis, is reproducible and is easily exchangeable, we propose and offer a free and accessible m. tuberculosis mst database so that microbiologists may compare the spacer sequence profiles they obtain with previously determined profiles for m. tuberculosis. the requirement for sequence analysis may limit the diffusion of mst to those laboratories that are equipped with an automatic sequencer, which is not a commonality in most laboratories, especially those in resource-limited countries. since mst uses pcr amplification as the first experimental step, it has the advantage of being applicable to dna extracts from inactivated mycobacterial cultures shortly after they are shown to be positive. the mst results were obtained in four working days. a similar, yet slightly longer delay of days between initial analysis and interpretation of results was recently reported when using the vntr/miru method. in contrast, the conventional is technique provided results in a median time of days. the delay period required to complete the mst analysis is certainly short enough to contribute to the interpretation of laboratory data that may have a significant clinical impact on patients. our report confirms the importance of rapid identification of cross-contamination. indeed, the misdiagnosed patient received unnecessary anti-tuberculosis therapy and the final correct diagnosis was slightly delayed. mst typing proved to be an efficient new tool for the detection of cross-contamination with m. tuberculosis. in addition, mst results may be obtained within a few days, which significantly improves the quality of laboratory processing and, therefore, the quality of medical care for the patient.", "model_summary": ["mst typing is a new pcr-sequencing-based genotyping method for the detection of cross-contamination with m. tuberculosis in the laboratory."],

gold standard for the proper diagnosis of tuberculosis in the laboratory. however, false-positive cultures have been reported that result from the cross-contamination of specimens via a contaminated bronchoscope or, more often, by laboratory cross-contamination. the latter situation has been reported at a frequency ranging from % to 3% of m. tuberculosis. laboratory cross-contamination should be suspected when m. tuberculosis is cultured from a smear-negative specimen processed in the same batch as a culture from a smear-positive specimen. the factors that increase the likelihood of cross-contamination include instances when only one of several specimens from the same patient is culture-positive and instances when the clinician is considering a diagnosis other than tuberculosis, which the clinician believes to be more likely based on clinical observations. such false-positives resulting from cross-contaminated specimens are disadvantageous since, besides resulting in a misdiagnosis, they result in unnecessary treatment and delay further diagnostic investigations in an effort to derive a definitive and correct diagnosis. finally, these false-positive cultures lead to an overestimation of the incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis in humans. a definitive demonstration of cross-contamination can be derived from precise molecular analyses of m. tuberculosis isolates. m. tuberculosis isolates harbouring identical genotypes are regarded as clones and are thus epidemiologically linked. the most widely used technique for determining the genotype of m. tuberculosis is a technique known as is6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. rflp analysis requires a large amount of biological material and, thus, poses a risk to laboratory workers due to the harmful nature of this pathogen. moreover, the latter method requires a substantial amount of time due to the fastidious nature of m. tuberculosis. more importantly from, a strictly technical perspective, is6110-rflp analysis does a poor job of indicating the presence of m. tuberculosis when these organisms contain only a few copies of the is sequence. recently, the variable number tandem repeat pcr-based technique and the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit technique have proven to be reliable methods for the resolution of cross-contamination events. we herein report the application of a new pcr-sequencing-based genotyping method, known as multispacer sequence typing, for determining whether specimens have been cross-contaminated with m. tuberculosis in the laboratory. case report a 60-year-old man was admitted for an examination to determine whether he had interstitial pneumonia. the patient had been previously hospitalised for two weeks at a different location with symptoms that included shortness of breath, a fever of °c, and a kg loss of weight within the past month. at the aforementioned hospital, a chest radiograph indicated the presence of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. subsequent microbiological investigations, including ziehl-neelsen staining and a pcr-based assay to test for the presence of m. tuberculosis on expectoration, indicated that there were no signs of such an infection. the patient was then transferred to our department for further evaluation. clinical examination of the patient verified both a body temperature of – °c and dyspnoea with 90% oxygen saturation under l/min oxygen. the medical history of the patient was unremarkable, except for previous treatment for arterial hypertension. the total body tomodensitometry indicated the presence of nodules in both lungs, in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and in a right axilar lymph node. the pertinent laboratory assays were performed and indicated a value of leucocytes/ml with 76% polymorphonuclear cells and platelets/ml. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was determined to be mm for the first hour. the lactate dehydrogenase level was iu/ml, the gamma gt level was iu/ml, the bilirubin concentration was μmol/l, the ast level was iu/l, and the alt level was shown to be iu/l. it was suspected that the patient had already begun to develop pulmonary tuberculosis and thus was recommended to receive anti-tuberculosis therapy since it was reported that m. tuberculosis was isolated from an expectoration that was collected days prior during the first hospital visit. due to the observation that the patient's respiratory status had worsened, the patient was admitted into an intensive care unit for a period of four days. the results of direct microscopic examinations using gram and ziehl-neelsen staining of a surgical lung biopsy were negative. this sample, cultured in bactec and in 5% blood agar in slant tubes, remained sterile after a two-month incubation period. subsequent histological examination discovered large b-cell lymphoma and further assessments confirmed that the patient had stage iv lymphoma that involved the lung, liver, and bone marrow. the patient then received the appropriate anti-lymphoma therapy. our investigation revealed isolation of a total of six m. tuberculosis strains from a laboratory that performed analyses for six different patients within a 2-week period before and after the isolation of m. tuberculosis from the index patient. all isolates were recovered from respiratory tract specimens and identified as m. tuberculosis by phenotypic methods and the etr-d sequencing method. isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received and handled on april 27th, while isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received on may 3rd, but handled for setting in culture on may 4th. isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received and handled on may 4th, while isolates tub tub and tub were recovered from specimens received and handled on may 8th. ziehl-neelsen staining was performed on all six specimens and the subsequent analyses revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli for all samples with

of plant photobiology research shows that plants possess complicated photosensory networks that monitor and respond to a wide spectrum of ambient light energies. the spectral sensitivity of the plant light-sensors greatly exceeds the range of human vision, as light effects on physiology have been observed from energies arising from the uv-b wavebands into the near infra-red. this broad range of environmental information is processed by integrated signaling networks that tailor growth and development to best fit ambient light conditions. light sensing pathways have been dissected through use of narrow-bandwidth light sources. since individual photoreceptors are generally tuned to sense specific regions of the spectrum, narrow-bandwidth irradiation allows isolation of effects associated with a particular waveband. for instance, the phytochromes mediate responses to red and far-red light, with partial activity extended through the green, blue and near-uv wavebands. cryptochromes are required for maximal response to blue and uv-a, while the phototropins exhibit autophosphorylation when stimulated with light qualities from the blue-green interface to uv-c. other sensors share sensory overlap with the phototropins, and at least several other receptors remain to be characterized. narrow-bandwidth, research-quality light is typically generated using a broad spectrum source filtered through an infra-red heat sink and several layers of acetate theatre filters or colored plastic. fluorescent lamps also are used, as they emit three principle light qualities that can be readily filtered to obtain narrow-bandwidth light. led light has been used principally in studies of phytochrome reversibility, as switchable red and far-red led arrays are commercially available. many reports have demonstrated the utility of red/far-red led sources in modulating phytochrome responses during de-etiolation, modulation of root growth, root greening and senescence. led technology has been incorporated into lighting regimes to modulate plant growth and development for decades as acute supplementation of sunlight or as the basis of plant growth in commercial chambers. additionally, led-generated light is well-suited for small growth chambers and other applications where a significant fluence rate is required, but little physical space is available for conventional lamps. the practical aspects of led lighting make them particularly well-suited for space applications where light treatments need to be precise and reliable with little heat radiation and low weight. leds may also be especially useful in retrofitting incandescent or fluorescent growth chambers for terrestrial applications. there is a need for a light source that may facilitate plant growth in a chamber environment, yet still allow for dynamic variation in light quality and quantity for experimental studies. such devices may reveal interesting interactions between light sensing systems. recent findings demonstrate that even \"benign\" wavebands have significant influence in plant physiology in concert with red and blue light. in this report we detail the design and construction of a compact led light array for use in plant research. these light sources utilize norlux hex-led arrays and are capable of delivering – μmol m- s- of combined red, green, and/or blue light. the design allows precise fluence-rate control of individual wavebands, allowing growth of plants under different combinations of light energies. these designs are the same as those used to generate plant-growth data in a number of recent studies of red, blue and green light interaction. two designs are presented in figures the first is a plan that may be suitable for use in the laboratory or classroom for fewer than one thousand dollars. the second depicts an expandable system that may be appropriate for large growth chambers. together the two plans presented represent tested and proven designs to introduce efficient lighting to chambers where light quality, quantity, duration and mixture can be readily controlled. the advent of new semiconductor technologies has inspired a marked decrease in the price of led-based devices. an increased number of consumer-grade products have become available to the researcher, and now these new tools may be integrated into various light-research applications. the goal of this work is to provide an interface between research needs and new technology. with this, the best-available research tools may be implemented by researchers without a significant investment in development. the plans presented herein offer two options for led light source construction, based on the need of an experimental illumination tool or requirement for large-area irradiation. led-based lighting regimes are being adopted by municipalities and medical facilities for their consistent, low-power, low-maintenance output. however, one of the most important practical applications of this technology is in the design for lighting regimes to support plant growth. it is of great interest to not only to foster plant growth, but to control plant growth. basic plant research has demonstrated that specific light wavebands may affect discrete aspects of plant physiology, such as germination, stem growth, biomass and the transition to flowering. the supplementation of specific wavebands or skewing of overall spectrum may help modulate the progression of these developmental events. the possibility that combinatorial light regimes may help to optimize growth and control developmental transitions makes the implementation of led technology particularly attractive to the design of controlled environments targeted to plant production for aesthetic applications, or applications relevant to human nutrition. if spectral quality alone can delay or hasten the floral transition it may have profound effects on modulating the delivery of nursery goods or perhaps affect the availability of consumable produce in a finite, controlled environment. this attribute alone makes led lighting a compelling platform for specific plant growth routines, such as those proposed for long-term inhabitation of space. since humans rely specifically on vegetative parts or reproductive parts of plants for nutrition, it is critical to develop systems which impart control of the progression of plant development to affect plant output toward the particular needs of humans. the implementation of narrow-wavelength led technology may benefit plant growth schema through supplementation or complete retrofitting of existing chambers. its compact design may replace existing infrastructure with long-life and consistent output. here, antiquated lamp systems, replete with toxic, inefficient fluors, may be refitted with efficient light sources that require little to no maintenance with comparable light output. although previously unattainable without substantial engineering, the geometry of the systems provided in this report brings led technology to the average plant biology laboratory. despite their vast advantages over conventional lighting systems, the led arrays described in this report offer opportunities for improvement and expansion. larger installations require close attention to array density, as the fluence rate of rgb hex led lights decays significantly toward the edges of the irradiation area. careful arrangement modified to the application lessens the frequency of \"hotspots\" or other gradients of light intensities under the light fixture. it is impossible to eliminate all variability under the arrays under all fluence rates and light combinations. the spacing of hex units in individual systems needs to be carefully tailored for the specific application. another potential improvement would be to integrate par sensors into the system to provide irradiance feedback and adjust light intensity through a computer-aided regulatory circuit. this would allow the user to enter a specific irradiance value for the desired wavelength and would compensate for changes in led output that occur over time and with temperature changes in the ambient environment. this system has been developed using leds emitting three principal wavebands. the clear extrapolation is to add additional led types to generate additional spectrum coverage. leds currently manufactured include uv, far-red and infra-red light. from the plans presented within this report it may be possible to develop lighting systems that roughly approximate solar output by compounding the effects of multiple leds. such a system may prove especially valuable in optimizing plant physiology and may have applications to human physiology as well. the arrays described were tested for support of normal plant developmental responses. these are most conspicuous in early seedling development, as initial responses to light are rapid, robust, and have been well characterized. three responses to light, namely inhibition of stem elongation, stem growth promotion and phototropism, have been extremely well characterized and may be used to test and verify the utility of these led arrays on early plant developmental responses. three assays were conducted. first, end-point stem growth was measured in plants grown under three fluence rates of red or blue light. red and blue light strongly inhibit early stem elongation through the phytochrome and cryptochrome systems, respectively. the results of two independent fluence-rate/response experiments using over seedlings are shown in figure 5a and 5b. figure 5a shows the height of seedlings grown for h under constant blue light and figure 5b shows the effect of the same treatment with red light. the cry and phyb mutants are presented as controls. the data show that constant blue or red light inhibit seedling elongation in a manner roughly proportional to fluence rate. inhibition is detectable even at low fluence rate, leading to a strong inhibition of stem growth elongation. the results of these trials mirror the previously published results, suggesting that the led arrays described herein act in a manner similar to those used previously. while phytochromes and cryptochrome effects are salient as stem growth inhibition after days of growth in constant light, other rapid responses involve other light sensors and can be measured on the order of minutes rather than days. contrary to the effects of red and blue, a short single pulse of green light stimulates rapid elongation of the hypocotyl in the dark-grown seedling. the response persists in all photomorphogenic mutants, it occurs when plants are grown in constant dim red light, and growth promotion is the opposite of what occurs when seedlings are irradiated with red or blue light. this evidence renders it difficult to conveniently ascribe this response to any of the known light sensors, and it is likely being mediated by a separate green-sensitive transduction pathway. figure 5c, shows the results of independent seedlings treated with green light from the norlux hex arrays, compared to previously published data. seedlings irradiated with a short, single pulse of green light begin to grow rapidly within min, attaining 140% of their dark rate before growth rate declines to dark levels after an hour. the results are highly similar to published findings, again indicating that norlux hex arrays are a suitable alternative to other led or fluorescent light sources. phototropism is the rapid curvature of the hypocotyl toward a unilateral light source. in arabidopsis phototropism is blue light induced and is mediated by the phototropins, autophosphorylating serine-threonine kinases associated with the plasma membrane. the response is exquisitely sensitive to blue light. here wild-type seedlings were irradiated from the side while being imaged in 5-minute intervals with an infra-red ccd camera. the degree of curvature was monitored over two hours and compared to previous results. the results indicate that the rapid response of phototropism is very similar between the arrays designed in this study and those produced commercially. as the availability of new technologies increases, research programs are challenged with the need to retool their capabilities to exploit their potential. since many of these new technologies are electronic and/or computer related, a certain degree of technical prowess is required to move ideas from the drawing board to application. the development costs of these technologies may be significant. this report offers two clearly applicable models of led light source development that may be implemented in the study of plant growth and output, helping to narrow the long-term challenges of illumination to support plant growth. these designs allow the fine control of specific wavebands shown to influence plant growth and development. such designs represent the first step in defining conditions that will optimize, or perhaps even control, plant growth and development. the light sources used in this report sustain normal plant early developmental responses, suggesting that they are an appropriate substitute for, or complement to, other plant illumination solutions.",

to be carefully tailored for the specific application. another potential improvement would be to integrate par sensors into the system to provide irradiance feedback and adjust light intensity through a computer-aided regulatory circuit. this would allow the user to enter a specific irradiance value for the desired wavelength and would compensate for changes in led output that occur over time and with temperature changes in the ambient environment. this system has been developed using leds emitting three principal wavebands. the clear extrapolation is to add additional led types to generate additional spectrum coverage. leds currently manufactured include uv, far-red and infra-red light. from the plans presented within this report it may be possible to develop lighting systems that roughly approximate solar output by compounding the effects of multiple leds. such a system may prove especially valuable in optimizing plant physiology and may have applications to human physiology as well. the arrays described were tested for support of normal plant developmental responses. these are most conspicuous in early seedling development, as initial responses to light are rapid, robust, and have been well characterized. three responses to light, namely inhibition of stem elongation, stem growth promotion and phototropism, have been extremely well characterized and may be used to test and verify the utility of these led arrays on early plant developmental responses. three assays were conducted. first, end-point stem growth was measured in plants grown under three fluence rates of red or blue light. red and blue light strongly inhibit early stem elongation through the phytochrome and cryptochrome systems, respectively. the results of two independent fluence-rate/response experiments using over seedlings are shown in figure 5a and 5b. figure 5a shows the height of seedlings grown for h under constant blue light and figure 5b shows the effect of the same treatment with red light. the cry and phyb mutants are presented as controls. the data show that constant blue or red light inhibit seedling elongation in a manner roughly proportional to fluence rate. inhibition is detectable even at low fluence rate, leading to a strong inhibition of stem growth elongation. the results of these trials mirror the previously published results, suggesting that the led arrays described herein act in a manner similar to those used previously. while phytochromes and cryptochrome effects are salient as stem growth inhibition after days of growth in constant light, other rapid responses involve other light sensors and can be measured on the order of minutes rather than days. contrary to the effects of red and blue, a short single pulse of green light stimulates rapid elongation of the hypocotyl in the dark-grown seedling. the response persists in all photomorphogenic mutants, it occurs when plants are grown in constant dim red light, and growth promotion is the opposite of what occurs when seedlings are irradiated with red or blue light. this evidence renders it difficult to conveniently ascribe this response to any of the known light sensors, and it is likely being mediated by a separate green-sensitive transduction pathway. figure 5c, shows the results of independent seedlings treated with green light from the norlux hex arrays, compared to previously published data. seedlings irradiated with a short, single pulse of green light begin to grow rapidly within min, attaining 140% of their dark rate before growth rate declines to dark levels after an hour. the results are highly similar to published findings, again indicating that norlux hex arrays are a suitable alternative to other led or fluorescent light sources. phototropism is the rapid curvature of the hypocotyl toward a unilateral light source. in arabidopsis phototropism is blue light induced and is mediated by the phototropins, autophosphorylating serine-threonine kinases associated with the plasma membrane. the response is exquisitely sensitive to blue light. here wild-type seedlings were irradiated from the side while being imaged in 5-minute intervals with an infra-red ccd camera. the degree of curvature was monitored over two hours and compared to previous results. the results indicate that the rapid response of phototropism is very similar between the arrays designed in this study and those produced commercially. as the availability of new technologies increases, research programs are challenged with the need to retool their capabilities to exploit their potential. since many of these new technologies are electronic and/or computer related, a certain degree of technical prowess is required to move ideas from the drawing board to application. the development costs of these technologies may be significant. this report offers two clearly applicable models of led light source development that may be implemented in the study of plant growth and output, helping to narrow the long-term challenges of illumination to support plant growth. these designs allow the fine control of specific wavebands shown to influence plant growth and development. such designs represent the first step in defining conditions that will optimize, or perhaps even control, plant growth and development. the light sources used in this report sustain normal plant early developmental responses, suggesting that they are an appropriate substitute for, or complement to, other plant illumination solutions.",

four of these were also non-motile. biogroup contained six strains and biogroup contained nine strains three of which were non-motile. biogroup was positive for malonate utilization and six of these were non-motile. biogroup was positive for indole and biogroup was negative for gas production from glucose. biogroup was defined by the inability to reduce nitrate. two of these strains were positive in the malonate test, three were negative for the inositol test and two were inositol negative but malonate positive. biogroup contained strains that were inositol negative and malonate positive. biogroup contained one strain that was inositol negative and indole positive, while biogroup contained one strain that was inositol negative and dulcitol positive. biogroup was also represented by only one strain, which was indole and malonate positive. the seven isolates in biogroup were negative for the voges-proskauer reaction, three were non-motile, one was negative for methyl red and one was negative for ornithine. biogroup was negative for ornithine decarboxylase and inositol, with four of these strains being positive for malonate. biogroup was positive for all the tests performed except methyl red. a new group had to be defined to accommodate strains which were inositol and dulcitol positive, but indole negative. they were malonate positive, with the exception of one strain. two strains were non-motile and one of these was also ornithine decarboxylase negative. acid production from α-methyl-d-glucoside was included in the original study and all biogroups were reported positive for this trait with the exception of biogroup as biogroup could be distinguished from the other biogroups without the α-methyl-d-glucoside test, this was not repeated for all strains in this study. phylogenetic analysis partial 16s rdna sequences containing less than 1% undetermined positions were obtained for all strains in this study. the sequences were analysed using the maximum parsimony method, which is an evolutionary model that searches for the simplest tree that can be constructed using the fewest inferred changes between characters. the topology was optimised using simulated annealing, a heuristic that occasionally accepts a worse tree during the course of the search allowing it to escape local optima. this method is more economical than the more usual heuristic searches, which can require many randon re-starts, especially with large data matrices. in agreement with previous reports, the isolates used in this study were divided into four genomic groups by 16s rdna sequence analysis. the majority of the presumptive e. sakazakii isolates in this study clustered with the type strain. cluster was composed of the majority of biogroups, biogroups 1– 7– and the isolates forming the new proposed biogroup corresponded with e. sakazakii cluster, with between – % 16s rdna sequence difference from the e. sakazakii type strain. no strains representative of this biochemical profile were included in the original study by farmer et al.. the six isolates in biogroup corresponded to e. sakazakii cluster. the four strains described as e. sakazakii cluster represent biogroups and for this dataset, the four partial 16s rdna cluster groups can be distinguished biochemically using the indole, dulcitol, and inositol tests. cluster strains are variable for inositol, negative for indole, and dulcitol; with the exception of biogroup which is dulcitol positive and inositol negative. cluster – biogroup strains are positive for inositol and dulcitol but negative for indole. cluster – biogroup is positive for inositol, dulcitol and indole. cluster strains were also positive for indole but can be distinguished from cluster as they are negative for dulcitol. one of the strains in cluster was inositol negative and one was malonate positive. there were insufficient isolates in cluster biogroups to determine whether these biogroups could be further genomically divided. discussion farmer et al. described biogroups of strains of e. sakazakii. five strains were used to genetically define the species by dna-dna hybridization and the remaining strain definitions were phenotypic. this study defines isolates in terms of both phenotype and genotype and extends the initial study with the analysis of strains. according to partial 16s rdna sequence analysis the majority of e. sakazakii strains clustered with the type strain, and within this cluster there was no clear further genomic division corresponding to biogroup. a second cluster of closely related strains was identified which were biochemically distinct from cluster and formed a biogroup that had not been previously described by farmer et al. these strains were not assigned a species match using the microseq or supplemental bacterial databases, but the nearest match was e. sakazakii. biogroup corresponds to e. sakazakii cluster while biogroups and correspond to e. sakazakii cluster. analysis of the full 16s sequence of strains corresponding to cluster groups and show these are less than 3% divergent from cluster group although dna-dna hybridization is the acknowledged standard for species delineation this technique was beyond the scope of this study, which focuses on evaluation of the biogroups reported when e. sakazakii was originally described. as well as defining a new biogroup, this study found subgroups within the original biogroups. the malonate and motility tests account for the majority of the subdivisions of the original biogroups. in this study, the majority of food isolates belonged to biogroups and all biogroups except and contained at least one strain from a clinical source. the greatest number of clinical strains was found to belong to biogroup. however, this included isolates out of the ten from the same hospital. therefore this may not be an indication of increased pathogenicity of this biogroup, but is likely due to an over representation of one clonal type from a single source. most of the food isolates belonged to biogroups and biogroup was the major group with approximately one third of the e. sakazakii strains. cluster was the major dna cluster, and was composed of biogroups 1– 7– and cluster is equivalent to biogroup and a new biogroup was designated for the strains in cluster for this dataset it is possible to differentiate the four genomic clusters using indole, dulcitol and inositol tests.", "model_summary": ["Enterobacter sakazakii is a pathogen mainly found in neonatal intensive care units, and outbreaks have been linked to contaminated powdered infant milk formula.", "It was previously defined as a new species using DNA-DNA hybridization and biogroups were described based on biochemical profiles.", "Recent studies using 16s rDNA sequence analysis have shown that strains identified as E. sakazakii using commercial identification kits form at least four distinct clusters.", "This study further compares and differentiates the biogroups and genomic clusters using biochemical tests and DNA sequence analysis.", "It identifies a new biogroup and subgroups within the original biogroups, and shows that strains in biogroup 1 are the most commonly isolated from clinical sources.", "It is possible to differentiate the four genomic clusters using indole, dulcitol, and inositol tests."], "label": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "source": "pubmed_zero_shot_faceval_domains"}

one of the most challenging tasks, especially for the many proteins whose functions remain unknown. traditional computational methods have utilized sequence features and machine learning algorithms to predict functions. in recent years, high-throughput technologies, such as yeast-two hybrid, have provided large scale protein-protein interaction data, making it possible to develop new function prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction networks. existing protein function prediction methods based on ppi can be categorized into two classes: direct methods based only on the protein interactions and module-assisted methods. direct methods directly infer protein functions from interactions in the ppi networks while module-assisted methods first try to find functional modules in the ppi networks and then assign protein functions based on the module functions. direct methods are based on the assumption that interacting proteins probably have identical or similar functions. this assumption is supported by previous studies which show that 70%-80% of proteins share at least one identical function with their interacting partners. schwikowski et al used a neighbor counting method to predict protein functions. they took up to three most frequent functions of interacting partners as indicators of the function of each protein, which turned out to cover over 70% of the known functions. hisigaki et al tried to predict protein functions by computing the chi-square statistics as an indicator of functions that were statistically significantly frequent among neighboring proteins. chua et al investigated the relationships between functional similarity and network distance. they utilized functional information from proteins within or neighborhoods of a protein by giving different weights to different network distances. vazquez et al assigned functions to proteins via an iterative algorithm by maximizing the number of edges that connect proteins with the same function. other graph-based methods include those of karaoz et al and nabieva et al. instead of predicting individual protein functions, module-assisted methods first identify functional modules in ppi networks and then assign functions to the proteins according to functions of the module members. these methods are based on previous observations that a group of cellular components and their interactions usually can be attributed to a specific function. the approaches of different module-assisted methods vary mainly on the methods for identifying functional modules, which divide the methods into those based on network topology only and those which integrate multiple data sources. network topology based methods include mcode, a module-assisted method based on clustering coefficients, the clustering method of rives et al and the hierarchical clustering method of spirin et al. ge et al showed that proteins having similar functions tend to have similar expression patterns, which can be used to predict protein functions. ideker et al developed a framework to identify active sub-networks by detecting significant changes in expression over a particular set of conditions. hanisch et al applied a co-clustering methodology that combined similarities in gene expression patterns and network topologies. hierarchical clustering was then used to define functional modules. although several existing methods have combined multiple information resources, such as gene expression information, gene regulatory networks and ppi networks, none of them have yet integrated protein domain information and ppi networks to predict protein functions. this paper presents a novel protein function prediction method that uses protein domain composition and ppi networks. this paper first demonstrates that proteins having similar functions are often in similar domain contexts in ppi networks and then develops the protein function prediction method based on this observation. the method gives satisfactory results compared to several existing methods. methods yeast ppi network data was obtained from dip database. proteins and protein-protein interactions were included in the network. the yeast ppi network was chosen because it is comparatively more complete with fewer missing interactions. nearly 70% of the orfs of yeast are covered by the yeast ppi network, which is the highest coverage ratio among ppi networks of all organisms. besides, the yeast ppi network is the most frequently used in previous protein function prediction studies, which allows accuracy comparison to other methods. the domain annotation information was retrieved from the pfam database. the hmmer software package was used to annotate domains in the yeast orfs. domains of domain types were obtained from proteins. the protein function annotation information was provided by the gene ontology database. domains are basic functional units in proteins. cellular functions are accomplished by the cooperation of many domains in proteins. therefore, the ppi network was decomposed into the domain level to investigate protein functions in terms of domain. figure shows a simplified model. protein a has neighbors in the ppi network, which all-together contain different domains, while protein b has neighbors with the same domains. domain shuffling or recombination during evolution may have changed the domain distribution among proteins. one possible situation is that domain is in the same protein with domain in one organism, while in another organism, it is combined with domain. despite the different domain distribution, similar domain compositions of neighbors of protein a and b in the ppi network may indicate both functional similarity and evolutionary relationship. thus proteins with similar domain contexts in the ppi network may share similar functions. the domain context similarity is defined as: where m is the number of domain types in the ppi network. given proteins a and b, sa and sb are the sets of domains included in a's neighbors and in b's neighbors. the number of domain types in sa is a, while the number of domain types in sb is b. the intersection of sa and sb is s, containing s types of domains. c denotes combinatorial numbers. the larger f indicates a greater probability that a and b share similar functions. for each go term, there is a positive data set composed of present proteins, and a negative data set including absent ones. for example, go: is used to describe yeast proteins, so these proteins were treated as positive samples. since some go terms contains only a few proteins and other go terms are too general, only go terms containing 10- proteins were considered. given a protein p with unknown function, in order to examine its function with regard to each particular go term, the domain context similarities, f, between p and each protein in both the positive and negative data sets were calculated. the function annotation of the protein with the highest f value was then assigned to p. the 7-fold cross validation, which has been widely implemented in previous researches, was used to evaluate the performance of our prediction. for every go term, both the positive and negative data sets were divided into seven equal parts randomly. every time six positive parts and six negative parts were used as the training data set while the remaining parts was used as the test data set. this procedure was repeated times to ensure that every part was used once as the test data set for one go term. then the whole procedure was repeated for every go term. the final accuracy was the average of the evaluations. four frequently used measurement indices, accuracy, precision, recall and mathew correlation coefficient, were used to evaluate the prediction performance. the mathew correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the prediction performance when the numbers of proteins in the positive and negative data sets differed significantly. mcc ranges from - to a larger mcc indicating better prediction performance. for data with positive predictions, the real positives are defined as true positives, while others are defined as false positives. for data with negative predictions, the real positives are defined as false negatives, while the others are defined as true negatives. then, the measurement indices are defined as: the relationships between protein function similarity and domain context similarity in the ppi network were investigated based on the measurement indices. first, pairs of proteins were randomly extracted from one go term with the domain context similarity, f, then calculated for each pair. secondly, another random protein pairs were generated using pair of proteins from different go terms. their f values are also calculated. the two sets of similarities were then compared to demonstrate the positive significant relationship between functional similarity and domain context similarity. the results showed that set a has a mean similarity, f, of compared to for set b. kolmogorov-smirnov test showed that set a is significantly higher than set b with a p-value less than 10- the distributions of the similarity for sets a and b are shown in figures and there are many values between and in set a, while most values in set b are near hence, the domain context similarity can be a useful index to predict protein function similarity. the method was then used to predict protein functions in yeast. go terms were divided into groups according to the number of proteins in each go term. go terms containing less than proteins were excluded due to the lack of a satisfactory number of proteins for accurate predictions. go terms including more than proteins were also eliminated because the function annotations in these go terms are usually too general. the results are shown in table the prediction accuracies are between 63%-67%. the results show that the method has satisfactory robustness for various numbers of proteins within one go term. as number of proteins increases from 10- to 100- the accuracy only decreases slightly, by about 4%. the phenomenon that accuracies decrease as number of proteins in the go term increases can be attributed to the fact that functional annotations in larger go terms are not as specific as in smaller go terms. fuzzy, general annotation information may affect the prediction performance. further investigation is required to explain this observation. besides, the recall is higher than the precision, demonstrating that false positive predictions are more common than false negative predictions. this method was then compared with existing methods based on the roc curves. the three previously developed methods included in comparison are mrf, neighbor counting and chi-square method. the random prediction performance was also presented. the roc curves shown in figure indicate that the current method outperforms the other methods. discussion a new prediction method for protein function based on protein-protein interaction and domain context was presented in this research. domain context similarity in the protein-protein interaction network was defined and used as in index for prediction. the underling principle of this method was that proteins tend to interact with each other via domain-domain interaction. so the high quality domain-domain interaction information may improve the prediction accuracy. riley at al developed domain pair exclusion analysis to infer high-confidence domain interaction from protein interactions. besides, dima try to identify known and predicted domain interactions which may be helpful if this information was utilized in our method. this research also suggests several future directions of research. first, domain context similarity measurements or prediction systems can be improved to reduce false positive predictions and boost accuracy. for example, the cutoff value for domain context similarity can be introduced to improve the accuracy and to deal with multiple function problems. since the underlying rationale of this method is the domain-domain interaction, high-quality domain interactions can definitely contribute to the accuracy. as mentioned above, the newly developed domain interaction inferring method can be used in our future algorithm improvement. second, as shown by chua et al, functional similarities exist between neighbor proteins with distances equal to or larger than which may be useful information to be included in function prediction. third, other data resources, such as gene expression profiles and gene regulatory networks, could be combined with domain context information to prediction functions. different weight can be assigned to different types of information. machine learning methods, such as svm, can also be utilized to take the information listed above as input features. finally, since protein domains are conserved and can be easily detected in various organisms, this method should be promising in comparing protein functions across species. the availability of large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to predict protein functions based on protein-protein interaction networks. several existing methods combine multiple information resources to predict protein functions. we present a novel protein function prediction method that combines protein domain composition information and ppi networks. performance evaluations show that this method outperforms existing methods. the results are used to analyze the relationships between domain context similarity and protein function similarity, while this research may have potential future research directions. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions zs, hc designed the study, collected study data, performed the

context similarity in the protein-protein interaction network was defined and used as in index for prediction. the underling principle of this method was that proteins tend to interact with each other via domain-domain interaction. so the high quality domain-domain interaction information may improve the prediction accuracy. riley at al developed domain pair exclusion analysis to infer high-confidence domain interaction from protein interactions. besides, dima try to identify known and predicted domain interactions which may be helpful if this information was utilized in our method. this research also suggests several future directions of research. first, domain context similarity measurements or prediction systems can be improved to reduce false positive predictions and boost accuracy. for example, the cutoff value for domain context similarity can be introduced to improve the accuracy and to deal with multiple function problems. since the underlying rationale of this method is the domain-domain interaction, high-quality domain interactions can definitely contribute to the accuracy. as mentioned above, the newly developed domain interaction inferring method can be used in our future algorithm improvement. second, as shown by chua et al, functional similarities exist between neighbor proteins with distances equal to or larger than which may be useful information to be included in function prediction. third, other data resources, such as gene expression profiles and gene regulatory networks, could be combined with domain context information to prediction functions. different weight can be assigned to different types of information. machine learning methods, such as svm, can also be utilized to take the information listed above as input features. finally, since protein domains are conserved and can be easily detected in various organisms, this method should be promising in comparing protein functions across species. the availability of large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to predict protein functions based on protein-protein interaction networks. several existing methods combine multiple information resources to predict protein functions. we present a novel protein function prediction method that combines protein domain composition information and ppi networks. performance evaluations show that this method outperforms existing methods. the results are used to analyze the relationships between domain context similarity and protein function similarity, while this research may have potential future research directions. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions zs, hc designed the study, collected study data, performed the

including hyperexcitability around the point of disruption, deviation of axonal projections from targets in the hemisphere contralateral to the pathology, and changes in thalamo-cortical connectivity. freezing lesions induced on postnatal day and p in rats resemble human four-layer microgyria. moreover, the presence of microgyria has been associated with rapid auditory processing impairments in rats. given evidence that disruptions in auditory processing may contribute to disruptions in language development, human microgyria could relate to human dyslexia, at least in part, through similar auditory processing disruptions. previous research indicates that injury to developing cortex during peak periods of neuronal migration results in greater decreases in brain weight and cortical volume as compared to injury occurring beyond the cessation of neuronal migration in rats. in fact, focal freezing lesions on p do not lead to significant decreases in brain weight, or cortical volume, nor the formation of four-layer microgyria as seen in p and lesion cases. surprisingly, focal injury on p or does lead to deficits in processing brief gaps in white noise as measured during the juvenile period, regardless of the presence/absence of microgyria or changes in cortical volume/brain weight observed. however, when rapid auditory processing was assessed in adult rats, only subjects with lesions induced on p were found to exhibit persistent rapid auditory processing deficits. these data suggested that despite early behavioral impairments seen with focal lesions on p1- cortical disruption specifically during neuronal migration appears to exert more pronounced and long-term behavioral and neuroanatomical effects as compared to injury occurring after the completion of neuronal migration. in terms of human research, neuromorphometric studies investigating the effects of developmental pathology on long-term behavioral outcome are scarce. however, recent studies suggest a link between early cortical developmental malformations and learning-related cognitive impairments on corpus callosum volume in rats previously assessed for auditory processing, brain weight and cortical volume. we predicted that changes in corpus callosum volume would correspond with the profile of change previously seen for brain weight and cortical volume, and that these changes would in turn reflect long-term behavioral outcome. post mortem histological analysis revealed no evidence of cortical damage in any of the sham subjects. post mortem analysis showed the presence of double bilateral microgyria only in the p and p lesion groups. the p lesion group, which received comparable freezing lesion treatments relative to the p and p groups, did not show evidence of microgyria. however, the p lesion group did show some disrupted cortical lamination in areas of cortex directly underlying the probe application points. lesions were seen mostly in sensorimotor cortex, with some extension into frontal, temporal, or occipital cortices. the majority of double lesions in p and p conditions appeared as one continuous severe microgyric lesion. however, the p group showed a pattern of disruption that was centered on the specific areas of probe application. this pattern appeared as four relatively small distinct pockets of displaced cortical lamination resulting from the freezing insults. corpus callosum volume a univariate anova was computed for corpus callosum volume, using age at treatment and treatment as fixed factors. results showed a significant main effect of treatment on corpus callosum volume, with lesion subjects showing significantly smaller callosal volumes as compared to shams. an age at treatment × treatment interaction was also found for corpus callosum volume, indicating that corpus callosum volumes were smaller as the age of injury decreased from p to p among lesion subjects, simple effects analyses revealed significant differences between p and p, and p and p, subjects. there was no significant difference between p and p lesion subjects. however, unlike the p lesion group, p subjects did show a significant reduction in corpus callosum volume compared to shams, indicating an overall reduction in corpus callosum volume similar to, but not as great as, the reduction seen in the p lesion condition. discussion the current findings show that focal bilateral freezing lesions to the developing cortex result in differential reductions in corpus callosum volume as a function of the timing of the insult. results show an age of treatment by treatment interaction, indicating that as the age at injury moves from p to p the corpus callosum becomes smaller. this progressive decrease in corpus callosum volume is evidenced by smaller callosal volumes in p versus p lesion, and p lesion versus sham subjects. although the cause of these changes is unknown, the current results add to previous studies showing reduced cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity, along with reductions in cortical volume and brain weight, resulting from p lesion-induced microgyria. as previously reported for the subjects in the current analysis, brain weight and cortical volume decrease as a function of the age at which injury occurs. specifically, p induced lesion subjects had the smallest cortex and brain weight compared to shams, followed by p and then the p lesion group. all of these data taken together suggest that changes in corpus callosum volume, in addition to cortical volume and brain weight, may represent an important clinical marker for the timing of cortical developmental pathology, which may contribute to some aspects of learning impairment. moreover, the current report provides increased support for the hypothesis that early injury to developing cortex can have marked effects on the volume of various structures directly and indirectly related to the point of disruption. we previously reported that p focal injury to cortex led to long-term impairment in processing short but not long duration gaps in white noise using a startle response paradigm. further, prior to the current analysis all subjects received a total of days of silent gap/reflex modification testing. during the juvenile period, all subjects in the current brain assessment received days of silent gap testing, in addition to days of silent gap testing in adulthood. briefly, acoustic testing involved the placement of rats on a load cell platform while a pseudo randomized set of variable duration silent gaps was presented in continuous db broadband white noise prior to a db startle eliciting noise burst. detection of the silent gap cue elicited a reduction in the startle response relative to an uncued trial, where no gap preceded the startle burst. importantly, subjects with the largest reduction in corpus callosum volume, as seen in the current analysis, showed the worst long-term behavioral outcome. specifically, p lesion subjects continued to show impairments in 2– ms silent gap detection after p whereas p and p lesion groups no longer showed the robust pattern of impairment. it is important to note that all of the subjects evaluated in the current study received the same testing experience prior to sacrifice. further, the nature of reflex modification insured that alternative strategies could not be used as with more complex maze learning or operant conditioning tasks. while the possibility exists that behavioral testing effected the brains of the three lesion groups or shams differently, the fact that p and sham subjects did not differ in corpus callosum volume suggests that age at injury was an important factor in determining long-term neuromorphological profiles across groups. further, even with repeated behavioral testing these results are especially important within the clinical context. however, future studies will seek to determine the effects of different types of experience on key anatomical markers, such as corpus callosum volume. although the results of the current study do not address the causal mechanisms underlying auditory processing impairments, they may represent an additional marker for the presence of developmental pathology which might be involved in the appearance of human learning impairments such as dyslexia,, as well as cortical developmental malformations. in recent years, as neuroimaging has become more accessible to researchers, the corpus callosum has gained increased attention as a target for possible pathology underlying developmental learning impairments. however, sampling in these studies is frequently limited to young adults and there is often little information regarding the timing or occurrence of pre/pari natal insults. therefore, the use of rodent models of focal cortical injury such as the one presented here may help identify possible windows during brain development at which particular structures are more susceptible to degradation, which in turn could lead to more pronounced long term behavioral pathology. the present data supports the notion that assessment of colossal morphology in populations at risk for neurodevelopmental pathologies, may help identify whether and when injury occurred, as well as predict potential long-term behavioral outcomes. the reductions in corpus callosum volume in the p and lesion groups are consistent with the reductions in brain weight and cortical volume previously reported for microgyric rats. current results suggest that disruption to the cortical plate during early postnatal development may lead to more widely dispersed neurovolumetric anomalies and subsequent behavioral impairments, compared with injury that occurs later in development. further, these

proteomes and often major parts of their metabolism and regulatory pathways. a systems level understanding of cells, however, will require the functional characterization of these proteins and how they work together. in recent years, a growing number of efforts have used high throughput assays to catalog gene expression, protein interactions, localization and metabolic activities. for many of these studies, the first step is to identify and then clone all the open reading frames encoded by the genome of the organism. here we describe the construction of a comprehensive escherichia coli orf collection in a gateway® entry vector. the library represents orfs or 94% of all protein-coding genes. the gateway® system facilitates the transfer of orfs into a large range of expression vectors that are suitable for downstream studies. here we demonstrate the utility of the e. coli orfeome by comparing it to other available microbial orfeomes and by testing a set of protein-protein interactions among species. the complete genome sequence of escherichia coli k- encodes protein-coding orfs. kitagawa et al. previously cloned all the e. coli orfs into an expression vector creating n-terminal 6xhis and c-terminal gfp fusions. however, the aska library cannot be used to flexibly transfer orfs into other expression vectors. libraries of all open reading frames cloned into highly flexible vectors will be needed to take full advantage of the information found in any genome sequence. we transferred the aska library into an gateway® entry vector by sfii restriction enzyme cloning. about e. coli clones which were not present in the aska library or which were not successfully cloned from the aska library into the gateway® entry vector were cloned directly by gateway® recombination. the entry clone library was then validated by dna sequencing. the resulting library represents orfs. the clone collection is freely available to academic users. the e. coli entry clone library lacks start and stop codons and is thus compatible with both n-terminal and c-terminal expression clone constructions. the clones from the entry vectors can be easily shuttled into different gateway-compatible expression vectors of many types in a high-throughput fashion. e. coli as a model for comparative genomics and biology e. coli k- has led basic life science research for more than half a century due to its easy manipulation and its safety as a non-pathogenic organism. we wondered to what extent it can also serve as model for pathogenic bacteria and compared the e. coli orfeome to all other bacterial orfeomes that are available as gateway-compatible clones. figure 1b shows how many e. coli genes have orthologs in these species including vibrio cholerae, yersinia pestis, streptococcus pneumoniae and others. for example, over 80% of e. coli cogs are conserved in pseudomonas aeruginosa. cogs represent conserved protein families and provide a standard way to compare gene sets. we can safely assume that the general molecular function of these e. coli proteins should be similar or identical to these homologues in other bacterial species. however, we cannot easily predict whether small changes in sequence will change the function or specificity of proteins. the availability of complete collections of easily moveable cloned orfs facilitates functional studies in multiple species in parallel, even at the level of whole proteomes. as of today, gateway® clone collections are available for at least bacterial species including strains of staphylococcus aureus. cogs should also facilitate comparative analysis, given that many of them are present in species for which orfeomes are available. for example, cogs are present in at least four of the species for which orfeomes are available. the e. coli orfeome for protein expression we verified the functionality of the entry clones by two different downstream applications. first, we tested recombinant protein production in e. coli by randomly selecting ten entry clones from the library that were subsequently cloned into the gateway® gst-fusion expression vector pdest-gst. the expression clones were transformed into the bl protein expression strain of e. coli and after induction of protein expression with iptg, the cells were lysed in sample buffer and analyzed by western blot. second, we tested protein interactions by the yeast two hybrid assay. about entry clones which are known to be involved in bacterial motility and chemotaxis were cloned into two different yeast two-hybrid expression vector systems and 90× = protein pair were tested for protein-protein interactions, resulting in protein-protein interactions. the e. coli orfeome for functional genomics and protein interaction analysis the availability of orfeome collections will greatly facilitate comparative functional genomic studies. an example of this is to compare protein-protein interactions among multiple species in order to determine which interactions are conserved. here we used the e. coli orf collection as well as previously generated s. aureus and s. pneumoniae collections to systematically test, by yeast two-hybrid, whether the recently described protein-protein interactions between the essential e. coli gene products ygjd, yjee and yeaz are conserved in these gram-positive pathogens. these three proteins were selected as an interesting case study because they are highly conserved, essential, and of unknown function. the yjee, yeaz, and ygjd genes are highly conserved throughout eubacterial genomes while ygjd orthologs are also found throughout the archaea and eukaryotes. we found all the interactions that handford et al. reported but there were significant differences between species. for example, yjee and yeaz from e. coli, but not from s. aureus or s. pneumoniae, interacted. the functions of these genes remain poorly understood. in e. coli, yeaz is able to proteolyse ygjd while yjee, an atpase, competes with ygjd for binding to yeaz. the inability of yjee to interact with yeaz in s. aureus and s. pneumoniae may indicate differences in the regulation of the ygjd-yeaz complex in these species. our study of these interactions not only demonstrated differences between the species tested but also showed another advantage of such a comparative approach: the s. pneumoniae yjee as well as the the s. aureus ygjd protein autoactivated the reporter genes when fused to the gal dna binding domain. this property affects approximately 10% of bait proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays. however, while the s. aureus ygjd bait is autoactivating, ygjd of e. coli and s. pneumoniae are not. hence, comparative assays may offer one strategy for circumventing limitations of the yeast two-hybrid method. additionally, by revealing which interactions are evolutionarily conserved, such comparative studies will greatly enhance our ability to interpret the conserved biological functions of the interacting proteins, and also the computational analysis of high-throughput protein-protein interaction datasets. for example, crystal structures are available for all three interacting proteins, but only one from e. coli, namely yeaz. in order to obtain more information for model building and functional interactions, we expanded our test set beyond e. coli and tested the interactions among ygjd, yeaz, and yjee in five different species, including h. pylori and r. prowazekii. in addition to the expected intraspecies interactions, interspecies interactions were observed. the s. aureus yeaz protein associated with the products of the e. coli and s. pneumoniae orthologs of ygjd while the s. pneumoniae yeaz protein was able to interact with h. pylori ygjd. this last interaction was particularly unexpected as yeaz is not conserved in h. pylori, and suggests the possibility that the functions of yeaz may be performed by another protein in this species. given the availability of orfeomes for more than a dozen species, such comparative analyses can now be carried out quite easily. more importantly, additional biochemical or genetic studies can be done in e. coli for which extensive resources, including deletion strains and comprehensive databases, are available. for instance, our e. coli clones could be used to complement mutants in other species, which would demonstrate their functional equivalence. in conjunction with other clone sets and the vast amount of genomics and proteomics data from e. coli, the gateway-orfeome will be another highly useful

for example, yjee and yeaz from e. coli, but not from s. aureus or s. pneumoniae, interacted. the functions of these genes remain poorly understood. in e. coli, yeaz is able to proteolyse ygjd while yjee, an atpase, competes with ygjd for binding to yeaz. the inability of yjee to interact with yeaz in s. aureus and s. pneumoniae may indicate differences in the regulation of the ygjd-yeaz complex in these species. our study of these interactions not only demonstrated differences between the species tested but also showed another advantage of such a comparative approach: the s. pneumoniae yjee as well as the the s. aureus ygjd protein autoactivated the reporter genes when fused to the gal dna binding domain. this property affects approximately 10% of bait proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays. however, while the s. aureus ygjd bait is autoactivating, ygjd of e. coli and s. pneumoniae are not. hence, comparative assays may offer one strategy for circumventing limitations of the yeast two-hybrid method. additionally, by revealing which interactions are evolutionarily conserved, such comparative studies will greatly enhance our ability to interpret the conserved biological functions of the interacting proteins, and also the computational analysis of high-throughput protein-protein interaction datasets. for example, crystal structures are available for all three interacting proteins, but only one from e. coli, namely yeaz. in order to obtain more information for model building and functional interactions, we expanded our test set beyond e. coli and tested the interactions among ygjd, yeaz, and yjee in five different species, including h. pylori and r. prowazekii. in addition to the expected intraspecies interactions, interspecies interactions were observed. the s. aureus yeaz protein associated with the products of the e. coli and s. pneumoniae orthologs of ygjd while the s. pneumoniae yeaz protein was able to interact with h. pylori ygjd. this last interaction was particularly unexpected as yeaz is not conserved in h. pylori, and suggests the possibility that the functions of yeaz may be performed by another protein in this species. given the availability of orfeomes for more than a dozen species, such comparative analyses can now be carried out quite easily. more importantly, additional biochemical or genetic studies can be done in e. coli for which extensive resources, including deletion strains and comprehensive databases, are available. for instance, our e. coli clones could be used to complement mutants in other species, which would demonstrate their functional equivalence. in conjunction with other clone sets and the vast amount of genomics and proteomics data from e. coli, the gateway-orfeome will be another highly useful resource for the e. coli functional genomics community.", "model_summary": ["Gateway® clone collections are a powerful tool for comparative functional genomics and protein interaction analysis."],
